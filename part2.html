			<p class="Body-Text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something occasionally has whispered me since hearing of the comfort my dear Mother takes in reading my last years journal that I ought for her sake to note down whatever interests me during my absence, to transmit to her, &amp; altho my life yeilds little variety &amp; therefore self &amp; my own thoughts must oftenest be the theme I shall not fear her criticism will be harsh or that one so indulgent, will turn away from my egotism. Perhaps I may revert to a few striking events during the past Winter on another page, but today shall begin my remarking upon the delightful length of day light, which induces me to rise early &amp; to leave my room in good time to see that my darling boys are at their scripture lessons &amp; hymns, to attend somewhat to the preparations for breakfast, to order up the “Sumavaa”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> &amp; to ring the prayer bell for my family devotions before eight oclock when we seat ourselves at table, after the blessing Jemmie gives us a verse from the psalms, Willie another &amp; I who wish to encourage them in the practise am ready with my response, thanks to our dear friends the Nichols<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> for the sweet example! One to look out upon the bright sun shine these days &amp; very clear sky might be tempted to hope a balmy spring temparature, but Winter still has his severe grasp firm as it has been these three months, the Thermometer still testifies to 22 deg Ro-<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> &amp; really returning from Church this noon as we met the sharp wind I feared little Willies cheeks would be frost bitten. We find our rooms fronting the Neva penetrated by it thro the double sashes &amp; I am at this moment wrapped in my grey Duffle Cloak<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> with feet upon a heated stool, with the desk dear M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winstanley presented me drawn to the warmest corner of my room- close by the Peach, which communicates heat to the drawing room. I try to think more of my comforts than of the extreme cold, but Oh how thankful I shall be when the weather moderates so that Jemmies long imprisonment may end &amp; Willie can have double enjoyment in having this dear brother with him on the skating ground, or at the ice hills. Whistler would go to Alexandrofsky after our two oclock dinner, tho it is so terrible to meet the icy breeze, wrapped in a Shube with a seal skin cap &amp; fur boots he looks defiance, &amp; business admits of no holidays to him but the blessed Sabbath, when he shuts his Chancelery to all &amp; we feel more than ever did before that it is our Heavenly Fathers next best provision to us poor mortals to the Bible. Last week was the beginning of festivities in the Square called Marcelaneetza, or butter week –<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> it is a sort of reconciliation to the severe fast upon which the poor Russians have entered <span class="CharOverride-1">this</span>, now of course all trace of amusement has disappeared until Easter, the food of the poorer classes will now be brown bread &amp; oil or salt for six weeks, ah how lamentable that those who ought to be their spiritual guides should not understand our Saviours words “not to appear unto men to fast.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> This morning we read the [58th] Chap of Isaiah<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> instead of continuing our course of the Acts of the Apostles<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> &amp; afterwards as I listened to the gospel appointed for Ash Wednesday,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> it struck me how exactly they accorded, in the first we are told to deal out bread to the hungry, &amp; in the other not to lay up treasures upon earth, evidently shewing that self denial &amp; a readiness to contribute of our abundance is the acceptable <span class="CharOverride-1">fast</span> in the sight of Him who knows our besetting sin to be selfishness. Yet far be it from me to condemn restraint upon personal indulgence of our appetites at this especial season which the fathers of our church have recommended by their example, but individual conviction must make it beneficial, &amp; it should be improved for self examination &amp; the study of Gods word to advance us in our course heavenward, where the worst of us <span class="CharOverride-1">hope</span> to arrive after the trials of this life are over, therefore I would that all who belonged to me would make this distinction between Lent &amp; other seasons, that they would withdraw more from the world, to prevent any dissipation of thought or time, which properly observed year by year would be a source of thankfulness throughout all Eternity. These anniversaries always carry my reflections to the rest prepared for the people of God. My little darling neice Looly<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> has been much in my thoughts today, if memory serves me right it is five years today since her Saviour took her back to His own bosom, &amp; propably now her dear mothers thoughts mingle with mine – How consoling that hearts can sympathise tho Russia &amp; America are in opposite hemispheres! Last week how favored I was by letters from Maria &amp; Kate, but above all my own gentle Mothers was full of love, I considered these as New Years presents from home, the most acceptable I could have received! What a contrast their open winter is to ours here, Kate gathered violets in her parterre on the l<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span>of Jan! she gratifies me by remarking that her little fair haired Georgy<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> reminds every body continually of my heaven born baby Charlie! ah how thankful I am when any of those who loved that gentle one, write me of him, for he is not dead to me! he is always upon his bereaved mothers pillow &amp; his fond tones mingled with Kirkies &amp; all “who have gone before” sound in memory when all other voices are hushed in sleep. – But here comes my good boy Jemmie with his history in hand to read to me as he does every afternoon= previous to coursing his German with Mademoiselle<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> before tea= we were fearful the boys should lose their own language, in other tongues, &amp; thus I gain a half hours enjoyment from hearing each of them read daily. May God answer my prayers for their happiness</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Tuesday March 25<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> Every week I feel how swiftly time flies yet can scarcely realize that it will be a fortnight tomorrow since I began what was intended as a journal But there is so little variety in my domestic life that nothing has offered worthy of record. I sent off letters to my dear mother &amp; Kate by the last Courier, &amp; began to write M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Lee<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> of Springfield in anticipation of the next opp for Liverpool. On Wednesday Whistler left us early in the morning &amp; took a charming sledge ride to Cronstadt with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes a distance of 29 versts on the Neva, they described it as something like old times in America, with their bells &amp;c wishing we had been with them, the road was so smooth &amp; the weather so bright, with no wind they were sure we should have enjoyed it, but as they had gone purposely to dine with Capt Kruger<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> of course we had not thought of it, he is an uncommonly interesting sailor to me, for his manners are softened by his deep religious feelings, &amp; Whistler as much as myself is glad to welcome this Englishman to our parlor circle when he can spend an evening in town. he treated them to “Sea pie” an excellent dish, from their description must be like a hodge podge from its variety of meat, vegetables &amp; pasty stewed in a pot. Debo to beguile the tedium of her fathers absence had invited the Misses Wilkes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> to tea, &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Ropes being deserted came in to join our ladies party, but it damped all our spirits that Aunt Alicia was taken ill &amp; obliged to keep her bed, she suffered several days from a cold she had taken, I was not aware how unwell she felt when I went the same day with our dear boys in Col Todds chariot &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">four</span> to the ice hills, they have been thronged lately as it not probable the season can last cold enough for them much longer. The Rizzleys<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> were there, as it was my first rencontre I was rather astonished at M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span>R seizing me by the hand as an old friend, but probably he was thus eager to meet me only as a countrywoman, his little boys of five &amp; seven years old were steering themselves alone as if accustomed to the steep hills all their days. of course my James felt impatient to try his skill, but as there was a shower of snow while we remained I feared their taking additional colds, &amp; they always find gentlemen glad to afford them protection &amp; a kneeling place behind their sledges. I was very much mortified at witnessing the capsize of our Ambassador while he condescended to go down hill with one of the young Englishmen, it is an amusement only suited to Col Todds grand children! but he is not easily discouraged by failures in foreign languages or customs &amp; since then has had several tumbles, for the ice hills are the rage &amp; he has his own little sledge there &amp; is learning to pilot himself. Last thursday evening instead of Debo going to the German Singing Society<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> she was taken ill as my sister had been, with chill, fever &amp; nausea, an epidemic it seems, I dont think she has suffered as much in many years, she is not yet able to leave her room, tho this afternoon she is enjoying M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes cheerful chat. what a dear kind neighbour this little lady is to us, when she came in with her work just now I thought “she finds time for every thing” for tho kept awake last night three hours by her Loulou<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> who is teething, I found her gay as a lark &amp; busy as a bee when I went to enquire after baby this morning, then she went to drive all the way to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Woods<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> thro sleet &amp; wind (for that friend is ill) after which I heard her practising singing (my room is between her drawing room &amp; ours &amp; I can hear all her high notes her voice is so powerful) soon her good little husband will be returning from Change &amp; then she will go in to cheer him at dinner &amp; devote her evening to him, for when not engaged in his Counting house they are inseparable, she really is a pattern of a Christian, wife &amp; young mother &amp; I have never known her fine temper ruffled. Last Sunday according to a previous notice D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Law preached a most admirable charity sermon for the poor funds of the British Factory, bringing before us our debt to them individually, that thro their supporting the Chapel we were all enjoying the blessed privilige of hearing the word of God in our native tongue in a strange land, &amp; proving to us how many were the demands upon the munificence from British emigrants &amp; poor,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> my good husband said if his purse had been full he should have willingly emptied it in so right a cause. little Willie tho not at all well had gone to church purposely to give his mite, one of the large vases at the door was opened for the offerings of the congregation &amp; as the attendance was very general I hope a handsome sum was collected. But my wish is soon to take to M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Law a contribution for the private charities of herself &amp; our pastor, the world knows not how many apply to them of the humblest, poorest class of British poor, they have lately taken rooms over on Vasili Ostrow to give an Asylum to some houseless, aged wanderers<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> &amp; the Sacrament offerings aid in supporting them, but of course it is not sufficient. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Law made great efforts to establish a Hospital to which was to have been attached a poors school, she held a Bazaar at the Parsonage in the Christmas holidays for it, but the factory opposed it<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> &amp; as they called D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Law twenty four years ago, he is still their servant. but he prays that God in his own good time will enlarge their views, that he may be allowed to do more for the cause of Christ in this land. Whistler described to me what a pretty neat Chapel &amp; parsonage is the English one at Cronstadt,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> (M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams is still preaching there)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> ah how much I wish I could worship once in that sanctuary where the body of my baby Charlie was placed until it was sent to its narrow bed across the Atlantic! But now I must summon my James to read, it is nearly six oclock &amp; I would not in sad sweet reveries of the dead, neglect my duty as a mother to the dear boys God still spares to us. As we were walking from Church on Sunday, our Ambassador overtook Whistler &amp; I, he seemed very eager to report to us what had occupied him all the day previous, three hours he had been among the Diplomatic Corps at the Kazan Church attending the funeral of the Countess Straughaunoff,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> the patroness of every benevolent &amp; charitable institution she had been &amp; she was universally beloved, as her death is now lamented. Then the Col told us of the English Club<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> dinner he had attended where he made a speech in Russ. comparing queen Victoria to the Queen of Sheba, but reversing the rule, by alluding to the Emperor Nicholas’ visit (as king Solomon) to her court.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> the col was quite satisfied as his fancies amused the Russians as much as English present.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Tuesday. April 1<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> Having just despatched my letters by the English Courier for the Boston Steamer (to Mother Maria &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʀ</span> Lee I will record the delight I experienced last evening when my young countryman George Prince came in with his hands full of American letters<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> for us. We had expected them all last week, but as they were directed via Hamburg they were so delayed, that harbour being closed by ice. Whistler had stepped out I sent the Dvanic to Col Todds<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> but he was not there. so I could wait no longer &amp; had read our dear Georges letter to him, &amp; was reading Marias ere my husband came to enjoy the same glad surprise. George wrote us from Brooklyn ere we supposed he had embarked from China! &amp; reported himself in perfect health &amp; now our hopes are excited that he will make a Summer voyage to see us.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span> But how seldom in this world of trial can joy be unalloyed – if we feel for others woes as our blessed Saviours example should teach us to do – the second page of Marias letter was filled with the sad particulars of the sudden death of Debos school mate Charlotte Canda.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> what a warning to us all but to the young especially! that “in the midst of life we are in death”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span> Whistler wept as he listened to the mournful but too true statement, for he remembered her as a child of most bright promise &amp; knew she was the idol as the only child of her Parents. She had attained her 17<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>birth day on the 3<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƨ</span>of last Feb &amp; having been invited to celebrate it at a friends house her father attended her thither to pass the evening taking a friend of hers in the Cab with them, at about eleven clock they bade adieu, after having probably had the usual resources of music &amp; dancing for Charlotte was a fine performer, the driver was ordered to stop at the door of Miss L. B……<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span>Canda handed her up the steps, which while he was doing a gentleman in another carriage called out in joke “you had better mind your own fair daughter, she is worth all others put together” then drove on- When poor M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> C flew back to his charge the Cab was no where to be seen, he thought as the night was so cold they had driven home, thither he ran, but no tidings from his servant at his own door of his daughters return, drove him half distracted to the stable calling aloud her name as he went- there he found the Cab empty! by the time he had regained his house again he met a summons to proceed with his distracted wife to a hotel where he understood Charlotte was ill! in truth she had been thrown out of the Cab by the horses taking fright while the driver had left his box to endeavour to warm his hands &amp; had been picked up by two gentlemen, her skull fractured by striking against the stone pavement, they carried the senseless sufferer into the hotel where she was recognized &amp; her parents sent for only in time to hear her last sigh! thus in a short half hour from her fathers leaving her, (- that brief moment -) he found only the senseless body of his Charlotte, who had been the delight of his eyes, the pride of his heart. It will be long ere that bereaved mothers shreik of anguish will be forgotten by those who heard it as she exclaimed “Wherein have I failed in my duty as a mother that God has taken my child from me?” Ah it is a fearful thing to <span class="CharOverride-1">idolize</span> what death must touch! to appropriate (what is only lent us to train for Heaven) to our own purposes. God had endowed this only daughter with much that might win hearts, &amp; if her Parents led her affections to her Saviour we must trust He has taken her to lead theirs to Himself. God does not willingly afflict, we poor blind mortals cannot see His purposes of Mercy thro the clouds &amp; darkness which surround His throne,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> but if we kiss the rod He will give us also the staff to support us. However sure seem earthly promises to us, they are deceitful, this world is not our home &amp; we must enter Heaven thro much tribulation! God called that beautiful young flower (we trust to bloom in Paradise) <span class="CharOverride-1">early</span> because He knew it best. Her parents position among the rich in a gay city, had placed her in the unsafe path leading to Fashion &amp; Folly and severe as they feel the wrench to them, she was taken from temptations &amp; trials which might have entailed everlasting woe. Debo remarks what a dutiful, affectionate daughter Charlotte was! her parents had toiled in their school, to make her rich &amp; accomplished - all their plans for this life were for Charlottes elevation. Where is she now? Oh may all parents profit by the lesson! Debo has lost in these two past winters two intimate associates younger than herself Fanny Peabody<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> &amp; now C. C. Oh may the still small voice continually remind her of the frail tenure of all earthly friendship, that she may strive to make Jesus the bond of union between herself &amp; all she loves, may she exert her influence with her companions &amp; with her brothers to lead them to Jesus. Many warnings have been sent us all within this last twelve month, those in the most elevated rank have not been exempt. Where are the two young brides of the Imperial family who previous to the Last Lent caused such festivities in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg?<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> the fair forms of each mouldering in the dust. And it was at the funeral of the G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Admiral Gregg<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> the tidings of the death of the Grand Duke Michels daughter overtook him,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-041">41</a></span></span> that very day was the anniversary of the Grand Duchess Helens<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-042">42</a></span></span> masquerade in honor of her nuptials! the news came that the young Duchess of Nassau had died on the anniversary of marriage, she had only been a few days ill. The Imperial family have appeared sincere mourners for the Emperors youngest daughter the favorite Alexandrine, until last evening I have not heard of their having been at any place of amusement, then as the annual charity concert was given for the sufferers in the Russian Army<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-043">43</a></span></span> it was indispensible. Debo wished much to attend it, but not a ticket was to be obtained. No doubt all her delight would have been changed into sorrow - if she had listened to the hundreds of instrumental &amp; vocal performers - the tidings of Charlottes death must long ring a knell thro all our memories. And our sympathies were also asked for Mary Bedford upon the death of her fond mother.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-044-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-044">44</a></span></span> how Mary clung to her! &amp; now she is an orphan at 18 years of age! but we hear she is resigned to the will of God, she sorrows not as those without hope. This evening I have promised to go to the German Acadamy<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-045-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-045">45</a></span></span> for sacred music with Whistler &amp; our Debo, she being one of the class, it is time for me to hear Willie &amp; James read now, dear little fellows how glad them seem at the prospect of their brother George coming to Russia!</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thursday l0<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>April.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-046-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-046">46</a></span></span> The weather has continued very wintry the past week, snow almost every 24 hours &amp; 15 deg of cold except where the suns power was felt. Whistler &amp; Debo went to Alexandrofski Sunday p-m<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-047-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-047">47</a></span></span> to their little congregation of Americans &amp; heard an excellent sermon from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ellerby, but they had a snow storm to drive thro returning. And since then Debo &amp; I have wished in vain favorable weather for making calls - until yesterday when her Russian master<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-048-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-048">48</a></span></span> came &amp; prevented her - I then took Jemmie to D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Thompsons<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-049-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-049">49</a></span></span> to have two teeth filled it was not a very tedious operation &amp; now I am thankful my dear boys mouth is in good condition. I found M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Harrison with my Sister on regaining our own home, the sun had not dissappeared when tea was ordered, we had quite a long table full, besides having to send it in the Chancelery to Whistler &amp; some officers, scarcely had I finished, when our footman summoned me to the drawing room to receive M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> De Glinkey,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-050-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-050">50</a></span></span> she had brought her little girl according to her promise to come some day sociably, &amp; I did not order a repetition of our repast immediately as the twilight was so pleasant for the childrens pastime &amp; I knew she must have lately left the dining table. I am always delighted to have a chat with this lady who is so fond of my own dear native land - and she is so domestic in her feelings &amp; so devoted to her children, it greived me to hear that her eldest boy had been ill &amp; therefore she had not brought him - as her husband is a Russian of course, her children must belong to the Greek Church, &amp; the unwholesome fast of Lent had quite disordered him, no milk, eggs, butter, or meat allowed, no wonder the mixture of oil in porridge, or the pickled fish had proved unsuitable for a hearty boy of five years old!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-051-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-051">51</a></span></span> &amp; then the fatigue of two hours standing thro prayers not intelligible at church (for seats are not admitted into the Greek church where all who do not kneel, stand. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> D. G herself a Lutheran dissapproves of ceremonies which cannot be explained to children &amp; yet is obliged to submit hers to this severe regimen. she told us of her little girl - not quite as old as my Willie - taking the Sacrament of the Lord supper! When tea was handed the little creature asked so conscienciously if there was butter in the cake which we offered her! fortunately there was dried rusk<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-052-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-052">52</a></span></span> without, I involuntarily expressed to the mother my opinion of the error of these seasons of <span class="CharOverride-1">public</span> fasting, &amp; she was even plainer in her judgement against them, we agreed that excesses were never becoming the followers of the self denying Saviour, but that the system practised here, of abstaining for a certain time &amp; then rushing into the extreme of indulgence was not upheld in the bible. when I alluded to the <span class="CharOverride-1">acceptable</span> fast spoken of in the 58 chap of Isaiah,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-053">53</a></span></span> she eagerly asked to see it, that she might enforce it in her mother=in=laws<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-054">54</a></span></span> family. Far be it from me to argue against fasting, where a feeling of humiliation in the sight of God prompts the self convicted sinner to afflict his soul so that the indulgence of the animal part of his nature becomes (as in the afflictions wherewith we are visited for our correction by the will of our heavenly father) distasteful to him. Our blessed Saviour tells us not to exhibit our fasting, we are not to appear to <span class="CharOverride-1">men</span> to fast, but in secret let it be to Him who reads the heart &amp; tests its <span class="CharOverride-1">sincerity</span>. I think Lent is wisely set apart by our church as a season for self denial in resisting the demands of the world upon our precious time &amp; thus giving us leisure in retirement for contemplating the wonderful love of our blessed Saviour, who as at this time spent whole nights in prayer for those “who know not what they do”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-055-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-055">55</a></span></span> &amp; who suffered for the sins of the whole world, if we are willing to prepare for the commemoration of Earthly conquests, surely we should not excuse ourselves from yearly devoting this season peculiarly to contemplating all that He has done to conquer death for us, whom He has purchased with His own blood, &amp; for whose immortal souls He still intercedes. He waits to be gracious to us! Good Lord make us <span class="CharOverride-1">willing</span>, as Tho art able &amp; draw us by the influences of the Holy Spirit! for we are our own enemies &amp; cannot approach Thee as we ought! Oh that all who are bound to me as a family on earth could feel that they are but travellers bound for the heavenly Jerusalem, where some of our loved ones have been early taken to await our arrival! then the service of Christ would be chosen in preference to the vanities of the world. We delight to <span class="CharOverride-1">speak</span> of that which engages our hearts, how strange then that the Saviour &amp; His interests are so seldom subjects of conversation! We are glad to serve those we love! And there is much that we might <span class="CharOverride-1">do</span> if we really had that supreme love for Christ which we all flatter ourselves we shall not be found deficient in, when called to testify by our works what place we shall occupy thro Eternity. We are not to <span class="CharOverride-1">bury</span> our<span class="CharOverride-1"> Talents</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-056-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-056">56</a></span></span> in the Earth. How little the young think of their accountability when all that they seek to accomplish is to charm away the present hour! &amp; they persuade themselves that their suavity of manner is proof sufficient of inward joy from secret communings with God. &amp; that it is enough to praise Him with the heart without the lips joining in it. But Oh is it thus in our home in Heaven? Angels &amp; glorified spirits continually sing Glory to Him who has redeemed mankind, &amp; as this world is only a school for that is it not rational to argue we should practise here what we hope to be perfected in here after. I delight in sacred music which lifts the heart to mingle in heavenly choirs. Ah if I were Empress of these vast dominions of Russia I should cultivate a taste for sacred music in the circles of fashion by prohibiting any other during the Lent Concerts at least, then Composers would turn their gifts into this channel &amp; the excuse would not be made, that no peices were to be found worthy the exalted subject As I am denied this enjoyment, I try to wait patiently till the holy spirit tunes the <span class="CharOverride-1">heart</span>, when the <span class="CharOverride-1">harp</span> will accord – k nowing I deserve nothing - &amp; finding refreshment in reading those works which lead my mind to heavenly joys. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Wilsons<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-057-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-057">57</a></span></span> letters in her memoirs awaken such feelings as I suppose fine musical compositions do to those who make music the feast of their fancy. When I examine myself after every day &amp; grieve over the many evidences I have shown of a worldly strife. Oh what doubts attend me of my love to the Saviour, who sought not His own, but others good. Oh that the Holy Spirit would endow me with long suffering &amp; great kindness! And when I contrast my idleness in the vineyard of Christ, to the labours of M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Wilson in India I fear that the light that is in me is darkness in the sight of Him, for whom I yearn to devote my all. I feel as she does with relation to children that “they are precious gifts from the inexhaustible fountain of our Heavenly Fathers love &amp; kindness to us” and that “we can only use the gift aright when we present it a willing sacrifice on His altar” her only prayer for her little ones was that they might be inspired with zeal &amp; love to become missionaries to the heathen! as she was herself – for herself with regard to them- she prayed always that she might realize her responsibility in having a little immortal to train for heaven! Few as are my proofs of love to my Saviour I trust I do not deceive myself in <span class="CharOverride-1">sincerely</span> desiring only spiritual gifts for my dear children, I commit their prosperity while on Earth to His providence, knowing that if they serve Him, they shall want for nothing. I am too eager now to see fruits of that love, Oh God give me faith to cast all my care upon Thee! my besetting sin is impatience Oh make me perfect thro suffering! &amp; answer my poor prayers in thine own good time that all mine may be thine! By thy power I have been enabled to rejoice that Thou has <span class="CharOverride-1">early</span> taken some of my little ones from me to dwell with Thee forever! Yet Thou knowest my heart does not separate them from those still left to cheer me, upon my pillow they are all embraced &amp; tho busy memory will sometimes harrow my tenderest sympathies with vivid views of past bodily sufferings, my tears are not bitter while I again fancy I hear Kirkie say “how sick I am,” or my babys gentle voice as in the last hour he spoke to his fond Mother, “Charlie’s most done,” no more medi - sank you dear Mama” for all that is passed I am assured was in mercy. They are not lost to me! &amp; Oh better still they are secured from suffering, their redeemed souls are where I prayed they might be: And in feeling thus &amp; thinking of the <span class="CharOverride-1">many</span> awaiting us <span class="CharOverride-1">at home</span>, can it be wondered that I should yearn to see those still exposed to temptations in this world, cultivate tastes for higher enjoyments than charm the thoughtless votaries of a false system of <span class="CharOverride-1">recreations</span>! This morning I have not walked as lately with my dear kind husband because he was too hurried with writing to go with me directly after breakfast &amp; hence after my bible reading I feel into a train of reflection &amp; have penned some of my thoughts which only my children can ever appreciate. A week has passed exactly since the last date on the other page for this [is] Thursday 5<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span>/17<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-058-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-058">58</a></span></span> of April, nothing remarkable has occured, except the thaw accompanied by delightful bright weather. Our children have left the breakfast parlor before eight oclock lately each morning to trundle their new hoops on the Quai with their Sister &amp; Governess,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-059-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-059">59</a></span></span> &amp; have brought home bright red cheeks &amp; buoyant spirits to enter the school room with &amp; to gladden my eyes. Jemmie began his course of drawing lessons at the Acadamy of fine Arts<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-060-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-060">60</a></span></span>= just on the opposite side of the Neva - the building exactly fronts my bedroom window= last monday, he is entered at the 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span>room<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-061-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-061">61</a></span></span> there are two higher &amp; he fears he shall not reach them, because the Officer<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-062-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-062">62</a></span></span> who still is to continue his private lesson at our house every Saturday is a pupil himself in the highest &amp; Jemmie looks up to him with all the reverence <span class="CharOverride-1">an Artist</span> merits &amp; his <span class="CharOverride-1">master</span> besides! he seems greatly to enjoy going to a class &amp; stands next a youth of 16 (Caslett)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-063-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-063">63</a></span></span> who being English notices my boy kindly. I congratulate myself for his sake that amusement &amp; health are thus united with improvement in his leisure hours. he could not cross upon the ice on the Neva yesterday, as the barricade has already been placed to prevent sledges<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-064-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-064">64</a></span></span> so he had a longer drive by the bridge, &amp; felt very important when he told me he had to give the Ishvostic 15 copecks silver<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-065-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-065">65</a></span></span> instead of ten! As he conns his tasks now directly after dinner (for the mornings recitations) he was ready to pursue a beautiful tale he has lately been reading to me until tea time, but he would have put “Ewen Malcolm”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-066-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-066">66</a></span></span> out of sight when Capt Kruger<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-067-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-067">67</a></span></span> called, if that frank sailor had not begged to hear how <span class="CharOverride-1">Americans</span> read, Jemmie did not dishonor his country by any awkwardness, &amp; gave our English friend a paragraph on Swiss scenery. My boys as well as their parents like to talk to this cheerful, excellent son of Neptune, he appears to me a sincere christian &amp; is always heartily welcome when he comes from Cronstadt, but as he was going to the Lecture (upon his favorite poet Milton)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-068-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-068">68</a></span></span> delivered by one of his countrymen at the Vestry room of the English church, he declined staying to tea. he &amp; Jemmie had a good natured argument about the prospect of a war between our two countries &amp; each came to the decision that the Oregon Territory<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-069-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-069">69</a></span></span> had best be left to the possessions of the Indians, that<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-070-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-070">70</a></span></span> that hostilities should be resorted to between people who ought to conciliate each other, as the only two nations upon earth of the same language, the same religion &amp; habits. At the Merchants Exchange where the English part of the S<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʊ</span>Petersburgh fraternity meet daily - War between America &amp; England is now the exciting theme, but I trust it will prove like many of their other speculations! which it is to their interest to indulge in merely as an incentive to trade. Much as I yearn to be recalled to my native land I pray it may not be the trump of War, which will make it my husbands stern duty to take up arms against a country I so much love as England. We wrote by tuesdays Courier.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-071-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-071">71</a></span></span> I to Eliza<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-072-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-072">72</a></span></span> &amp; a note to poor M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Canda. Debo to Jule &amp; that lady. Old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon came that day to dine with us. she was cheerful &amp; grateful as ever, Whistler was most attentive, handed her in &amp; placed her at his right hand, she was the life of our circle &amp; told us her 81<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span>Anniversary of her birth day would be next Sunday!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-073-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-073">73</a></span></span> In the afternoon Debos fond father could not resist her invitation to promenade with her in the Nevski, as for a rarity he was not hurried by business from her side, she came back with a border of mud upon her silk dress! indeed he said he had had to ferry her across the Isaacs square<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-074-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-074">74</a></span></span> in a Sledge &amp; wade over on foot himself! old M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Leon laughed &amp; threatened Debo that she should report what a termigant of a daughter we have, to compel her father to parade her thro the fashionables at such cost! The old lady was obliged to bid us good evening at 9 1/2 lest she should be locked out. I smugged<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-075-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-075">75</a></span></span> a bottle of fresh cream under her cloak, as she is obliged to deny herself the purchase of such luxuries. I always think most of my own mother when I can shew kindness to one who is like her, cheerful, useful &amp; so neat &amp; erect. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Strokoffski<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-076-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-076">76</a></span></span> came &amp; also Capt Klockoff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-077-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-077">77</a></span></span> to spend the evening sans ceremonie. I hoped, agreable as they are, that when M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwells friend made his congé<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-078-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-078">78</a></span></span> at eleven, Whistlers aid would also take his leave but he chose to seat himself again. I soon stole off tho it is rather awkward doing so for my room is adjoining our Salon de compagnie, but I had the fidgets &amp; I cannot reconcile it to my conscience to jumping into a prayerless bed - from which many never rise - it was a quarter past twelve before my head touched the pillow, &amp; yesterday I was up at quarter to six, for between the day light at four peeping in &amp; Debos bird on our window greeting it, and my desire to have breakfast in good time for my children to gambol in the fresh air before school time, I cannot indulge in the sluggishness, which in Russia I have yeilded too much to, the warm rooms create it, &amp; since coming here I have had no darling little Charlie to awaken me.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday afternoon l9<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>April.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-079-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-079">79</a></span></span> Tomorrow will be Palm Sunday russian style.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-080-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-080">80</a></span></span> these last three days the Gostinandvo has been filled with toys to tempt the lower classes &amp; children, tomorrow it will still be thronged by those who do not recognise the Sabbath as “<span class="CharOverride-1">rest.</span>” Aunt Alicia not having seen the spectacle went with my boys &amp; Mademoiselle today. Willie appeared to think me exercising self denial &amp; tried to persuade me to be of the party, he &amp; James came back laden with gew gaws to the value of a silver ruble apeice - and pleased their mother that they had sought something for each of our good servants, my dear Jemmie has not been quite well lately; one or the other of my boys seem ever affected by the Neva water, God grant them health! it is indeed a grief to me to observe dear Debo too so feeble this spring. But I am thus constantly reminded that this is a world of care. As next week is one set apart for devotion in the Greek church the Concerts even are put a stop to &amp; all the Italians go elsewhere to make new engagements I suppose.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-081-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-081">81</a></span></span> I am relieved that the season is over, as my daughter will no longer be tempted into crowded rooms, to keep late hours, she has not been able to resist musical attractions, &amp; yet is too little restored since her last illness to rise till we have finished breakfast, besides the privation it is to me that she is not among us when we meet at family worship, I know the excitement is injurious to health. The Empress had signified her wish that a Concert should be held in the “Salle de Noblesse”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-082-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-082">82</a></span></span> at four rubles argent a ticket the profits for Orphans under her patronage,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-083-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-083">83</a></span></span> &amp; of course for so good an object &amp; to see the Imperial family in that most magnificent room in all Europe, we would not refuse, even Martha Ropes who has scarcely left her room this year has been bracing her strength for the exertion. I have always supposed it might be, expected of me that I should be able to say I had seen the Imperial family &amp; the Hall of the Noblesse &amp; this had caused me to reserve this <span class="CharOverride-1">charitable</span> public amusement when I excluded myself from all others, so altho I would rather have staid quietly at home with Aunt Alicia &amp; my boys, I suddenly yeilded to Whistlers wish that I should go with Debo &amp; himself, something whispered me “you know not what changes may occur to prevent another season”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-084-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-084">84</a></span></span> &amp; I went rather to have it over than with any anticipation of selfish gratification. The crowd was not so great as was expected, but the heat excessive, &amp; altho the Empress &amp; the Grand Duchess Olgar were in the canopied &amp; gilded box surrounded by ladies of the Court, I should judge from the lack of elegance in the costume of the crowd it was not the most fashionable this gay metropolis boasts of. I must confess that across this immense room I could not discern the features of the Empress &amp; her beautiful daughter to my satisfaction, altho the general effect of their appearance was quite regal. the former entirely in white wore feathers &amp; diamonds, the latter dressed in pale blue wore flowers in her fair hair (for at the birth of the 2<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span> infant son of the Héritier about six weeks since a Ukâse had been issued requiring the general mourning for the two young Grand Duche’ss to be discontinued)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-085-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-085">85</a></span></span> I did not wonder they only lingered long enough to evince their interest in the <span class="CharOverride-1">charity</span> which they had begged the public thus to contribute to, for the music was too loud to be endurable to one of weak nerves &amp; the heat made the place like a Purgatory, the poor Empress has not been in the world since her beloved Alexandra left it, &amp; I trust her <span class="CharOverride-1">heart</span> will never return to its follies. For myself the delight I felt was that such places no longer could interest me &amp; nothing could again tempt me into them, for tho Garcia, Rubini &amp; Tambourini<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-086-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-086">86</a></span></span> sung solos or trios it was not to my taste, my imagination guided by my husbands description of the splendour of the Salle de Noblesse had far exceeded what I really found it to be, he was tired as I was Debo looked fatigued &amp; very amiably offered to leave before it was over, but we depended on M Ropes <span class="CharOverride-1">Russ</span> for calling our Coach &amp; they like to see the last as well as the first of every thing. We all wondered Martha who has lately been so subject to swooning should have had strength to get thro the crowd, &amp; then we were all exposed to catching cold waiting out in the Street till our Hackney<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-087-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-087">87</a></span></span> could come up after all the Court equipages. the carriages having all been formed into line by the Gen d’armes who surrounded the place to keep order. How much trouble is taken to procure <span class="CharOverride-1">good</span> out of evil! thought I! it is a question if every one had contributed their four rubles silver without the amusement whether the clear profits had not been greater! but men are children of a larger growth,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-088-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-088">88</a></span></span> &amp; few willing I fear to give of their abundance without some earthly equivalent, A reward is promised in Heaven! But I condemn not those whose opinions differ from mine. I only regret that they barter a certainty for an uncertainty. Music at home with a few dear friends to enjoy it with us, is a source of unfailing delight, &amp; I shall wish never to out of it to seek it, unless to Church. It is a happiness to have ones mind made up as to what constitues <span class="CharOverride-1">enjoyment</span>, experience has decided me, there can be none in scenes which distract our thoughts &amp; prevent us mingling heavenly prospects with them. I have not attempted to describe the Salle de Noblesse for it would be folly in me to attempt it, the pure white pillars not of marble but a kind of composition are many &amp; divide the wide promenade for spectators or loungers, from the centre appropriated to dancers, which of course was filled with seats at the concert, the throne or Imperial box is gilded &amp; in the most conspicuous situation about half way from where the musicians are placed &amp; the entrance, ever greens are always used as decorations upon its steps, eight immense chandeliers of crystal are reflecting the most brilliant light over the company &amp; many smaller ones at the sides &amp; thro the corridors make every corner bright almost as sunshine. Oh how glad I was to get home at eleven o clock, I was too tired even to partake of the refreshments Aunt Alicias thoughtful attention had provided, I left Debo &amp; her father to divide the jelly &amp; dry rusk &amp; thus gained time at the eleventh hour to collect my thoughts for reading &amp; commending all I loved to the mercies of our Heavenly Father. It was past midnight when my weary limbs were at rest.</p>

Martha Ropes spent the rest of the day with Debo, quite frolicsome, the noisy concert has made her quite rife for amusement I fear, in the evening her brother Joseph joined us at tea. I took french leave<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-090-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-090">90</a></span></span> of the circle while I read to my boys &amp;=then one of M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span>Neills excellent lectures which he wrote especially for Passion Week upon the Sympathies &amp; sufferings of our Saviour,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-091-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-091">91</a></span></span> to my Sister, for I knew the young trio at the Draft table would not require me; &amp; I have determined not to let trifles prevent our reading this week what is so appropriate. We were just at the close of the lecture upon the treachery of Judas Iscariot when Debo came to say good night, as Martha has to keep early hours, on my return to the parlor M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Joseph &amp; Whistler were so deep in public affairs I found they could dispense with me &amp; gladly retired to my own snug apartment for the night. The Neva presented a strange scene this morning, hundreds of men forming a line thro its centre cutting a passage, to break the force of the ice when nature unlocks its fetters, to save both bridges from injury. Certainly the Russians are most remarkable for precautions, to save life or property. In our country it would be a serious expense to cut up a river as they are doing the Neva. but here the Emperor must be well satisfied that it gives employment to so many of his poorest subjects. We went again to prayers at Church, every seat appropriated to the ladies was occupied. some ventured to the gentlemans side, I thank God that I felt His presence today in the midst of us! &amp; not fatigued altho the service was long. We read the Psalms for the 9<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>day - &amp; how beautiful are those Epistles taken from Isaiah<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-092-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-092">92</a></span></span> for both yesterday &amp; today! Martha R dined with Debo, who took a drive after, with her, but complained of the bleak wind &amp; rough Streets.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Friday 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span>May<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-093-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-093">93</a></span></span> We had a kind note from the Parsonage reminding us that it was 20<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>April old style the wedding day of our Pastor &amp; that altho no invitations were ever sent out M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Law always received their friends that evening. Debo recalled a pleasant dance the last anniversary &amp; was delighted at the prospect of another. I determined not to resist this effort at sociability as I had done all their formal invitations to large parties for I felt we could not expect to receive our Pastors family under our roof if I always refused their hospitality. after shopping with Debo in the way of artificial flowers &amp; white gloves for her I felt very much fatigued for the streets were in a most uneven state, but my kind Sister relieves me of household cares so after a warm bath I laid down with a book &amp; thus missed seeing M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gellibrand when she called. which I regretted exceedingly as she has not been well enough to go out lately. Altho the weather was so unfavorable it was by turns snowing or drizzling we met quite a number at nine o clock, after the kind reception from our Pastor &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Law - who looked so bright &amp; happy upon this their 30<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>anniversary,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-094-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-094">94</a></span></span> that they might well have made all <span class="CharOverride-1">the single</span> present willing to enter the list for matrimony - we took tea in the little carpetted parlor, but soon after were drawn to the large entrance room with parquet floor by the sound of music &amp; dancing. I knew Debo was at the piano for it was one of the waltzes she often plays &amp; she is never among the waltzers. By turns the parents of the young ladies chatted with me, &amp; found<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-095-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-095">95</a></span></span> that some <span class="CharOverride-1">very</span> few dissapproved of this mazy movement as much as I do. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Catley<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-096-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-096">96</a></span></span> remarked that the Polka was only suited to the stage! I thought it only becoming mere children! M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> F. Baird<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-097-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-097">97</a></span></span> looked well notwithstanding she was in the same quadrille with her son Charles,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-098-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-098">98</a></span></span> for the quiet of Passion week had restored her somewhat after a long winters dissipation, she wore new diamond, her broach was so novel I could not but look at it tho I am seldom attracted by jewellery, it was in the form of lily of the valley the single leaf of enamel, the sprig of lilies upon it of large diamonds. perhaps if the English Ambassador<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-099-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-099">99</a></span></span> had not complimented her upon her good taste I should not have noticed it. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Law &amp; I had a nice talk about her darling little grand children.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-100-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-100">100</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Caslett<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-101-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-101">101</a></span></span> took an opportunity of expressing a hope that we should be at her ball next week but I excused myself - Attracted by some beautiful plaister models of Thorswaldens exquisite sculpture I had a full description of the originals in the church at Copenhagen which made me wish more than ever to go there.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-102-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-102">102</a></span></span> Soon after Whistler came in (business had detained him at home until half past ten) I took french leave, as Debo would be under his guardianship &amp; was in my own room before eleven, listening to a cheerful letter from Preston<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-103-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-103">103</a></span></span> which my Sister had received &amp; felt compensated for the exertions I had made for others by an approving conscience the Searcher of hearts knoweth that my enjoyments are not in the world! I often err no doubt thro my wish to gratify my dear daughter for my judgement &amp; experience both condemn the false system of <span class="CharOverride-1">enjoyment</span>, the world offers, but I so yearn for sympathy from Debo, that I am willing when there is no glaring folly to meet her more than half way. her father could not persuade her to leave the gay throng until after supper &amp; I was not asleep when they came home at one oclock. I grieved that Whistler should be distressed by her selfishness, for tho he makes many sacrifices of his own inclination to attend upon this only daughter, he expects consideration in respect to his peculiar views of propriety, &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">late hours</span> her health will not bear, however he ever evinces forbearance from reproaches &amp; probably she was not aware how much she had dissappointed her dear father when he kissed her fondly as usual for good night, &amp; I hope she rested better than he did, for her cheek looked pale &amp; her eye languid, tho she persuaded herself the <span class="CharOverride-1">excitement</span> would do her good. I can see our Heavenly Fathers wisdom in exiling us from our native land where Debos intimacy with many gay circles, might tempt us to yeilding entirely to her inclination &amp; thus health be wasted, here the evil effects of dissipation are so glaring that even she must be assured we are right in confining her to a very limited participation of gaieties <span class="CharOverride-1">natural</span> to <span class="CharOverride-1">youth</span>.</p>

M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Ropes brought in her work &amp; sat in my room where I had stationed myself at my work table for I am just now much interested in replenishing my husbands stock of linen, she is invariably cheerful &amp; affectionate, I was grateful to her for bestowing so much kind attention upon me. Jemmie was taking his drawing lesson. Willie gone with Mary to see his little friend Scharschinka Drury who has been shut up with effects of measles all winter nearly &amp; now has very sore eyes - Aunt Alicia with <span class="CharOverride-1">willing feet</span> attending my family arrangements in pantry, dairy &amp; kitchen, so dear Ropes chat quite dissipated the sadness I might have yeilded to <span class="CharOverride-1">alone</span>, when last I was cutting out shirts it was four summers ago shut up in my room at Springfield, Sister Julia assisting me, dear mother then my house keeper!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-106-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-106">106</a></span></span> Ah how much I think of her so far away! but God appoints our separation therefore I check even the rising wish that it should be otherwise. It is exactly a week since the last letters by the Boston Steamer reached us. I can scarcely define my emotions when <span class="CharOverride-1">this feast</span> of <span class="CharOverride-1">many letters from home</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-107-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-107">107</a></span></span> came in late Saturday evening, after the calm of Passion week, we had every day been contemplating the love of our Saviour for us, &amp; had after divine service on this last day of the week partaken of that holy Supper which is to shew forth His death &amp; resurrection. Sister had just finished one of McNeiles most touching lectures<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-108-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-108">108</a></span></span> appropriate to the season, &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">the world</span> with all its contending interests seemed to have retired, How full was my whole soul with love &amp; thankfulness as I perused my mothers letter! it was long &amp; satisfactory, for altho it told us darling Willie Wyatt<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-109-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-109">109</a></span></span> had been extremely ill, it pronounced him convalescent &amp; but for it, I should very naturally have allowed my imagination to picture only Marias anxious watchings &amp; her exhausted frame. dear Sister! it is trying to be so far from you when I might by sympathy at least mitigate your sorrows! Whistler did not get back from Alexandrofski that night till late, his letters from George &amp; the Gen<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ɲ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-110-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-110">110</a></span></span> kept us wakeful, May the infirmity be compassionated which induced me to mingle thoughts of those dear absent ones with my prayers on Easter Sunday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-111-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-111">111</a></span></span> at church! Why cannot I cast all my cares for <span class="CharOverride-1">others</span> on God, as I do the future in temporal things for myself? I know He knows what is necessary to fit us all for <span class="CharOverride-1">the last great change,</span> I experience that His chastisements are in love &amp; in the review of my own life am so convinced of the benefit of affliction that I would not have had one stroke less if I might choose-yet I tremble for those dear ones for whom I daily pray “all things may work together to bring them near to God<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-112-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-112">112</a></span></span> &amp; that they “may count all things as nought compared to the knowledge which is in Christ Jesus”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-113-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-113">113</a></span></span>- Oh how small is my <span class="CharOverride-1">practical</span> faith! In the afternoon of that Sunday as we had no public worship I read to my dear James &amp; Willie from their favorite Abbotts “School boy”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-114-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-114">114</a></span></span> - how astonishing that any of the children of a larger growth even considered wise men in the world should reject such counsel! the lesson in this little world are admirably adapted for all capacities to yeild happiness for this life which may be delightful contemplations thro out Eternity. Debo drove with M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Harrison to the service at Alexandrofski – Whistler took M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> H to Tsarskoe Selo to see Col Todd &amp; get a peep at an American newspaper if possible, as our Ambassador never sends us such a favor - We all met at tea &amp; partook of some of Aunt Alicias nice sweet curd &amp; cream.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-115-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-115">115</a></span></span> her friend old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Baird having provided her with Rennet,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-116-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-116">116</a></span></span> which we could not buy here – But I linger a whole week &amp; must skip back to last Sunday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-117-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-117">117</a></span></span> to note down that the bridge of boats having been drawn back from the Quai in anticipation of the breaking up of the ice all the portion of our congregation belonging to Vassili Ostrow were prevented attending church, I was not well enough to go in the morning &amp; enjoyed quiet reading at home, &amp; was thus invigorated to listen to a most excellent discourse from D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Law in the afternoon text 2<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span> Epistle of S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Peter 1<span class="CharOverride-9">st</span> chap 10<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>verse.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-118-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-118">118</a></span></span> What a pity so few were there to profit by it! Ah how strange that <span class="CharOverride-1">christians</span> who can make leisure for every day to throng the Church during Passion Week, should yet absent themselves every Sabbath afternoon from joining in public worship. merely upon the plea of <span class="CharOverride-1">hospitality</span> to friends; or <span class="CharOverride-1">family</span> enjoyment, perverting the 4<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> Commandment<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-119-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-119">119</a></span></span> to their own injury. Oh how long it is before early habits thus formed can be broken, that we can feel it a privilige to spend the Sabbath in communion with heavenly objects &amp; that it becomes indeed a day of <span class="CharOverride-1">rest</span>. God will bless our endeavours to keep it holy, even if our natural estrangement towards Him tempts us to question the benefit we shall reap from <span class="CharOverride-1">perfect</span> obedience “We shall reap if we faint not.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-120-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-120">120</a></span></span> Oh if we could but remember that we have to deal with a just &amp; jealous God as well as a merciful &amp; compassionate Saviour, what remorse might be spared! but human pride asserts <span class="CharOverride-1">human</span> priviliges &amp; like the Israelites on their journey we continue to rebel: And thus Canaan<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-121-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-121">121</a></span></span> is lost to multitudes now as then.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday 5<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of May I was aroused unusually early by the voices of Whistler &amp; all the young ones in the drawing room, even Debo in her dressing gown was there to enjoy the sight of the flowing Neva, yes its dirty winter garb had been cast off in the night &amp; tho the weather continues cold we may hope an agreable change. The ice continues floating in great dirty flats all day &amp; as the wind rises the chilly feeling increases. Henrietta Law<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-122-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-122">122</a></span></span> to pass the evening in practising with Debo, we enjoyed a most gorgeous sunset at eight oclock. beautiful starlight succeeded, Whistler found us still lingering over the tea table when he returned after nine from Alexandrofski, he was very glad of a hot cup of chocolate as he said he had not suffered from cold in a drive during the winter.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-123-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-123">123</a></span></span> We amused ourselves looking over “Letters from the Baltic”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-124-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-124">124</a></span></span> while the music was going on. I had read Miss Rigbys work before I left Boston, but since becoming familiar with Russian scenes it is much more forcible, one of her remarks upon the baptismal ceremony in the Greek Church made me laugh they cross the eyes to express the vow not to look upon evil, the mouth to prevent the utterance of evil communication &amp; she thinks the same charm of the &#134; must be passed upon the nose, as Russians seem not to be annoyed as others are by the odious smells which infest every avenue to the public, their churches, Acadamy of fine Arts &amp;c – By the way I may mention that our home on the English quai is directly facing that last named imposing building, the window in my room is opposite the principal ferry stair,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-125-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-125">125</a></span></span> &amp; if ever I am at a loss for variety I can watch the embarkation of the passengers in the ferry gondolas, tho I rather think it will only be interesting to me when Jemmy is among them, for soon as the ice is all gone he hopes to cross three times a week to take his drawing lesson at the Acadamy.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-126-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-126">126</a></span></span> But the Governors boat from the fortress is always the first to cross, none dare venture till he has gone thro the ceremony of filling a glass with Neva water &amp; on presenting it to the Emperor in the Winter Palace has a goblet of gold peices in return for the <span class="CharOverride-1">intelligence</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-127-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-127">127</a></span></span></p>

Of course I took a nap after thus gratifying curiosity. The young folks took a walk upon the quai after breakfast, &amp; came in complaining of cold, except Jemmie whose cheeks looked like damask roses. Debo &amp; I wore our Shubes when we went in the Droshky to the Gostinandvo, to purchase a riding habit for her, &amp; were glad we had not sent away our furs, which we discarded long before, last Spring. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes met us quite a pro-pos in the market &amp; made some good bargains for us I was tempted to purchase a pretty Moscow silk<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-129-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-129">129</a></span></span> to send to America, &amp; also one or two dresses for my spring out fit, as I have only my black bombazine now in wear. On our drive returning past the Palace we saw the quai on the island completely manned, from the Fortress to the bridge, hundreds of people &amp; from the firing of cannon we knew the governers boat was upon the voyage across the Neva, in the afternoon the river was alive with gondolas how glad the island population must be that their embargo is at an end, still carriages must wait for the replacing of the bridge, floating ice will be an impediment for a while &amp; besides, with all their watchfulness &amp; authority, two of the boats forming the bridge were carried down by the ice, while probably the lazy Russians dozed on their post.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-130-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-130">130</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Harrison came in while we were at dinner &amp; repeated his wifes invitation to my Sister for her promised visit, so she agreed to return to Alexandrofski with him, she instructed Mary in all her duties to save me exertion during her absence &amp; then made her own few preparations. dear kind Sister! how shall I feel when she is packing up to go to England! while even the prospect of this weeks absence made my heart sad, much as I hope she may enjoy the visit to our amiable young Countrywoman &amp; her sweet children.</p>

I had great satisfaction in the hour I spent with these affectionate children &amp; practised some of my bad french upon their Governess by way of encouraging her, as she is timid &amp; a stranger, not able to converse in English tho she comprehends it when spoken. Then there was all the new furniture to admire &amp; the improvements in their house to approve, so the time flew while Whistler was in the works making some experiments in iron. We set out before sunset – right glad were we of our furs for the air was frosty still, how much we enjoyed our nice tea, home made bread &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">home churned</span> butter as also bonny claba &amp; cream<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-139-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-139">139</a></span></span> at nine o clock - our boys were ready by the time I had finished for me to read to them as Mary had taken care they &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hadenskougg should have a plentiful bread &amp; milk supper before my return. What beautiful evenings we have now! the ruby glow of sunset continues at the horizon &amp; the bright stars &amp; new moon are so brilliant in the clear canopy above. Oh how I delight to feast my eyes thus after the duties of the day are over &amp; I have quiet &amp; leisure to reflect upon the past, how I pity any who can look unmoved upon the wonders of nature! &amp; I am grateful that I inherit my mothers taste for such contemplations, Grandmother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-140-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-140">140</a></span></span> &amp; “the little ones who have gone <span class="CharOverride-1">home</span> before us are fond associations with Gods own coloring in the firmament, and soon memory will bring many sweet pictures before me when the approaching season, for flowers greets me. But we must wait for May blossoms yet awhile, not a spear of grass yet! the ice has continued in sight all the week upon the river, tho the barges continue to ply with passengers between the city &amp; island, the bridge is often drawn to one side to let the masses from Lake Ladoga thro. how perfectly pure &amp; white it looks in comparison to that which was walked over by thousands during the long winter upon the river &amp; canals. And as there is no avail in being impatient I try to admire even this variety from muddy ice, to fresh &amp; clean. One certainly does not take the lively interest in a foreign land we do in our own, where nature dictates to us when to expect singing birds &amp; blooming violets. Poor Martha Ropes is anxious for suitable weather to see all she can in the neighbourhood of S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburgh before her long voyage back to Boston. &amp; we hope a brief spring for her enjoyment. she has been sitting with us this morning, working secretly at slippers to surprise M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gellibrand on his birth day which will be next tuesday,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-141-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-141">141</a></span></span> while her fingers have plied thus industriously, she has been talking of the intended wedding of D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> H.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-142-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-142">142</a></span></span> their family physician, it is to be “published” tomorrow at the English church. the long smothered attachment between him &amp; Miss J– <span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-143-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-143">143</a></span></span> has so suddenly revived that it has become the <span class="CharOverride-1">interesting</span> theme in the English circle. his little girls think it will be quite a blessing for them to have a new Mama &amp; I trust she may exercise such an influence over them that her task may be rewarded, they have been rather too little controlled, but they are reasonable &amp; affectionate - &amp; she gentle - scarcely double Alices age will no doubt win them, for her love to their father it is said has undermined her health &amp; she was their own mothers favorite companion - one of the few who saw that beautiful &amp; excellent woman in her great sufferings during the three days after her sudden attack which was ended in death about three Summers ago.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-144-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-144">144</a></span></span></p>

My life is so monotonous that I can only tell them what they know that distance only strengthens the cords of family love &amp; that I envy even every scrawl I send home. I miscalculated about a semi monthly Steamer for April &amp; thus brought dissappointment to myself instead, must be more patient &amp; not indulge in <span class="CharOverride-1">anticipations</span> in future. This is the l<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span> of May, Russian style, weather very cloudy &amp; moist, but I dare say this unpropitious aspect of the clouds will not prevent the usual fête at Catrinoff,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-146-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-146">146</a></span></span> as the rich will go around the gardens in equipages better than if the dust of yesterday had been attended by its sunshine &amp; the poor heed not the weather, the <span class="CharOverride-1">holiday</span> they will not lose. occasionally we see fields of ice floating down the Neva from Lake Ladoga, so green fields would not be in keeping. &amp; I am sure they never dance around a May Pole<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-147-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-147">147</a></span></span> near this city whatever the peasants may do in the south of Russia, I would go to the fête myself to see that, but in all their holiday games here there has been no exhibition of gladness of heart, one never hears a merry laugh or sees a bounding step, they swing, or ride on hobby horses with the same decorum they would enter church, &amp; to a reflecting observer it is sad to witness that on Gods own holy day the seem most unrestrained. last Sunday afternoon we attended M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ellerbys preaching at Alexandrofski as the Harrisons invited us us to be present at his farewell discourse to our countrymen the Mechanics at his works.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-148-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-148">148</a></span></span> My feelings were perhaps peculiarly solemnized by the view which had been presented of using every means for salvation, &amp; the crowds of idle Russian peasants herded together on our ride back to town really distressed me, some sleeping, some drunken, some playing their native game with bones,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-149-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-149">149</a></span></span> I wondered those who could speak their language should not warn them of their misapprehension of Gods commandments, <span class="CharOverride-1">immortals</span> merely vegetating in their short uncertain state of probation, how can the thousands of protestants of the English here be indifferent towards the poor, good natured peasantry, whose language they are so eager to learn, to employ them for their own convenience. It is not surely enough to excuse them when all shall stand together at the judgement seat of Christ, that the Greek Church was considered <span class="CharOverride-1">christian</span>. Oh when shall the true light be given to the Shepherds of this countless flock! that they may exert their power over them to make them happy for time &amp; eternity.

			<p class="Body-Text">June 6<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> <span class="CharOverride-1">Old Style</span> today is &amp; 18<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> our calender<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-151-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-151">151</a></span></span> – My illness interrupted for two weeks any record of family events &amp; feelings – since then preparing sundry gifts to send my Sister Kates children by M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gellibrand &amp; Martha Ropes who embarked last week for Boston required all the effort I could muster in my debility after so much fever. I have not felt so ill in many years as upon taking cold in a drive a damp afternoon with my dear husband to Alexandrofski, a cough I had fancied could not attack me in Russia for I had never been two years exempt from one till my residence here, but it racked me distressingly &amp; with fever in my head my whole nervous system was deranged. Never can I forget D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Rogers untiring attention, at first visiting me twice a day, then once &amp; still he looks in upon us two or three times a week. What a comfort too to have the tender care of my dear husband, soon he must leave me for a fortnights absence on the rail road, but thank God it was not necessary while I was ill. My kind Sister too relieved me of all domestic anxieties &amp; Mary anticipated all my wants. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes too used to bring her sewing &amp; sit beside me, but I was not allowed to talk, so visiting my room was rather discouraged by the doctor &amp; my watchful husband. however when I could read, my spirit was refreshed by perusing the “Memories &amp; Remains of Murray McCheyne of Dundee”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-152-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-152">152</a></span></span> which delightful work a young Scotsman had lent me just before &amp; ere I had quite finished it, Capt Kruyger set me the Rev<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> George Williams new work on the Holy Land,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-153-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-153">153</a></span></span> I must try to read it thro ere his return from England, for it was a farewell loan when my boys favorite called to say adieu.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-154-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-154">154</a></span></span> &amp; there is scarcely another copy of the work in Russia. nothing could have drawn me from the perusal of so interesting a volume but the necessity of aiding our dear Debo in getting her wardrobe ready for a contemplated visit to her Aunt Winstanley. and I have felt glad that my strength was sufficiently restored to drive as far as the Gostinandvor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-155-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-155">155</a></span></span> to shop for her &amp; more important yet that I could ply the needle for her notwithstanding a constant pain in my side. The weather is still very unfavorable to my getting rid of that, bleak winds continue to prevail &amp; vegetation is at least a month behind what it was the last season. While a prisoner to my room W<span class="CharOverride-9">m</span> Maingay arrived from Germany bringing tokens of his Mother &amp; Sisters regard for us. I have not yet seen him as he has only called to deliver these, &amp; has not appeared at church the two last Sundays,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-156-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-156">156</a></span></span> when I have been there. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ɵ</span> Millers return from Scotland<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-157-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-157">157</a></span></span> caused quite an excitement in our house about the same time for he sent so many packages, curiosity was quite rife. but Aunt Alicia soon unravled the mystery, she had commissioned him to purchase her some tokens of her love for us all, a beautiful suit of dark blue silk tartan for each the boys, a bible &amp; prayer book bound in one for me, &amp; a unique travelling case for Whistler, knife fork &amp; spoon of steel &amp; silver. How often this warm hearted Sister brings my dear departed father<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-158-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-158">158</a></span></span> before my minds eye! may she be blessed for all her proofs of a Mothers love to me! since my earliest recollections I look back upon her care for me, &amp; now that religion has purified the bond of sisterly attachment, we sympathize more truly than ever. she could not have given me any thing so valuable as the complete volume which is now my companion in the solitude of my chamber &amp; when I attend the house of God. I have resigned to darling Jemmie now the Polyglott bible<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-159-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-159">159</a></span></span> which was his sainted brother Joes &amp; since his death had been prefered to me to any other, because of the association, may James be aided by the holy spirit to love &amp; to value the <span class="CharOverride-1">unpretending</span> looking volume! But I must not omit to record that we received also by M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> M many other tokens of friendship. his brother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-160-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-160">160</a></span></span> wrote the kindest note to my husband offering for the acceptance of Debo &amp; myself curious pebble brooches &amp; a tartan scarf to the former to experiment upon – &amp; the <span class="CharOverride-1">bearer</span> managed to slip in a pretty Edinburgh reticle with the Thistle embroidered in gold upon satin tartan. Then Eliza Stevenson now M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Tom Smith<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-161-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-161">161</a></span></span> sent her (with the sweetest bride like effusion descriptive of all her wedded bliss! the tiniest embroidered pocket handkerchief - which had been one of the bridal presents to herself. Soon as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Miller ascertained that I had resumed my place at the family board, he invited himself to dine with us one Saturday, telling me in his note I need not fear he would wear out his welcome by staying all the evening for he had an engagement at 7 oclock – however he put that off, for the weather was tempting enough to make Whistler accede to his after proposal of all taking a drive to the Alargna<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-162-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-162">162</a></span></span> one of the charming islands where the Imperial family have been since the ice dissappeared. I did not go of course, my boys brought me a bunch of butter cups the first wild flowers which have greeted my longing eyes this season. &amp; they told me of having hailed W<span class="CharOverride-9U">m</span> Maingay who was rowing a party in his English barge<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-163-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-163">163</a></span></span> in his sailors costume. Debo &amp; Mademoiselle regretted I had not been there to meet the beautiful Grand Duchess Olgar &amp; Empress. but I had enjoyed a tranquil hour or two at home much more, for the trifling exertion of entertaining a guest or two was fatiguing to me, still so weak. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> Miller made the boys merry as crickets, gave them a lesson in a Highland dance to the quickest time Debos fingers could move over the keys. But after tea when Capt K<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-164-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-164">164</a></span></span> would have proposed more music our frank Scotsman opposed it, as out of all reason to begin again after ten. the twilight is really so deceptive no wonder the lovers of amusement encroach upon the hours when we should be at our devotions, previous to rest. I was obliged at last to steal from the drawing room to my chamber, which M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Miller thought was hint enough that it was time to make his congé.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">If I had not been to busy, until taken ill, I should have recorded the magnificent spectacle we witnessed on the 14<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of May.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-165-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-165">165</a></span></span> Capt K had succeeded in obtaining a window for us in the 4<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> Story of the Prince of Oldenburghs palace overlooking the Champ de Mars,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-166-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-166">166</a></span></span> &amp; tho it was rather humbling to our <span class="CharOverride-1">independent</span> spirits to have to wander thro his stables &amp; once stand to one side while the Emperors daughter passed from her chariot to the honored part of the palace we mounted the wearisome back stairs &amp; found we were favored, among a distinguished few ladies &amp; officers who had reached the desirable eminence before us. It is impossible to convey a conception of the effect of 80.000 troops with their field peices, banners &amp;c glittering in the Sun Shine,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-167-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-167">167</a></span></span> for the weather was propitious, altho a slight shower obliged the Empress &amp; Grand duchesses to abandon their elegant English equipage after they had driven thro the avenues among the troops to receive their cheers. we had a perfect view of these beautiful women, the Grand duchess Olgar was dressed in sky blue, the wife of the Héritier in pink &amp; the Empress in Lilac. the troops in their new gaudy uniforms of every hue gave the effect of a vast bed of tulip. The Emperor rode proudly among them, no one could have mistaken any other for the monarch tho the Grand Duke Michel (his brother) the Grand duke Alexander &amp; Leightenburg<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-168-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-168">168</a></span></span> followed close upon him. What a multitude of splendid horses were there &amp; so exactly alike for the several batallions. As the Emperor received the shouts of the several companions as the passed him in their maneuvers methought he looked too proud for mere mortal &amp; I wondered if he remembered the presence of the King of kings! for I thought how small was all this array in comparison to the Armies of heaven. On three sides of the square field were palaces, on the fourth the Summer Gardens, so that the dull realities of life were completely secluded &amp; yet I could not forget them, in my minds eye I contrasted the sheep skins of the ignorant &amp; dirty peasantry &amp; I knew too how many hearts were wrung to afford this army numbers for its ranks,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-169-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-169">169</a></span></span> &amp; while famine raged in the interior<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-170-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-170">170</a></span></span> it must be supported at an expence which would have made the poor comfortable, &amp; what was all this for? to display the power of one man &amp; to make his subjects tremble to disobey his slightest wish, a silver ruble was to be given to each soldier after the review,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-171-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-171">171</a></span></span> in how short a time thus nearly 80.000 would be squandered in drunken revelry. The maneuvers detained us many hours &amp; an elegant luncheon was sent to every apartment in the palace for its visitors, chicken salad made more refreshing by jelly of calves feet as one ingredient, the nicest cold ham I have tasted in Russia, &amp;c, followed by ices, we scarcely needed that dinner should have been ordered at six oclock at home. I was most delighted at the modest politeness of my little Willie that day. he attracted much notice from a Russian family which shared our window, answered them in french or russ whenever addressed &amp; proved that he was grateful for the kindness of the ladies, by offering to put down their empty glasses &amp; plates as he observed them in their way. darling boy! may he never become conceited or selfish! I do not like to make comparisons, for Jemmies eagerness to attain all his desires for information &amp; his fearlessness, often make him offend us because we love him too tenaciously to be reconciled to his appearing less amiable than he is, the officers however seemed to find amusement in his remarks in french or english according as they accosted him. they were soon informed of his military ardor &amp; that he hoped to serve his country – England – no indeed! Russia then? No, no, but America of course!) My poor boy how little you dream of the horrors of the battle field, a review is the pageant of the sad reality. but I should pray you may be clothed in the whole armor of God.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-172-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-172">172</a></span></span></p>

I told her all must be ordered for her good as we had taken every means in our power, she would yet find it providential that she was delayed, still her first &amp; last question night &amp; morning was about Steamers for England, &amp; her father was urged to get Col Todds aid in obtaining her passport, at last all was arranged to her satisfaction, the money pd for her berth in the Hull steamer<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-175-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-175">175</a></span></span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Cotton<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-176-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-176">176</a></span></span> delighted to taken her under her care &amp; she felt it long to wait till thursday of this week. her father was obliged to start for the rail road last Wednesday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-177-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-177">177</a></span></span> &amp; his parting words were “be a good girl &amp; write me often from England.” we looked for American letters that day by the Lubec Steamer<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-178-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-178">178</a></span></span> which was due, I wondered what Debo would do if she heard George had made up his mind to visit Russia in the course of the Summer, tho I concluded we should not have him till August as I thought he would embark in a ship from Boston to Cronstadt. I advised Whistler to leave me an envelope directed in Russ to overtake him on his route interior in case of letters, which he did. But instead of letters, came George himself the afternoon of the day his father left home for Moscow in 24 hours more Debo too would have been gone! who can say <span class="CharOverride-1">chance</span> has aught to do in the events of a day. Our very hairs are all numbered,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-179-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-179">179</a></span></span> &amp; our Saviour never loses sight of those who put their trust in Him. my constant prayer is that He will guide each one of us &amp; that all things shall work together for our eternal progress to His right hand. Delightful as were my emotions on welcoming my dear Son, when the excitement was over &amp; I left to reflect upon the unexpected changes of the day - a kind of awe mingled with gratitude to God, and I wondered if we should yet see some especial purpose of our Heavenly Father in His arrangements for us this Summer - perhaps not - many would ridicule my <span class="CharOverride-1">superstition</span> but tho my health is sound &amp; my prospects of long years to come are flattering I always realize how slight is the tenure, &amp; tho I would not say so to others, the thought has more than once occurred that dear George was sent here &amp; Debo detained at home for a mothers blessing.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-180-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-180">180</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>May the Holy Spirit make me willing in the day of His power to cast my whole care upon God! Debo became as eager to get rid of her ticket for a place on board the Rob Roy as she had been to obtain it, &amp; the agent behaved most generously in returning its value. After she had read her letters which her dear brother brought &amp; admired all the gifts sent her by her young companions she took a tete a tete stroll up the Nevski with him, and I was left to rest on my sofa with the refreshment of my dear mothers letters, for Aunt Alicia had an engagement at Alexandrofski whither she was accompanied by Mademoiselle &amp; Willie - and I persuaded Jemmie to attend his drawing class tho he could not bear to lose hold of brother George! he went for two hours to the Acadamy of Fine Arts &amp; Mary went to ride, with M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes darling little trio of girls &amp; two nurses,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-181-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-181">181</a></span></span> as she usually does two or three times a week- My loved mother had picked a wild flower from the grave of my little Kirkie &amp; Charlie, &amp; dried it to send me, it is a precious gem to me! and those heavenly lines upon the Adoption,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-182-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-182">182</a></span></span> soothed my spirit as strains of sacred melody.

After tea George came &amp; sat beside me talking of Stonington &amp; Brooklyn till I could almost fancy myself there. but our bodies were tired tho our spirits were eager still for all that each could give of the past! We only wanted my dearest Whistler at home to render our happiness complete. but he had just left us for a fortnights absence! George &amp; I determined to write him immediately &amp; forward all his American letters - which he was bearer of - we did so the next day.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-183-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-183">183</a></span></span> How very sudden the transition must appear to our dear George, leaving Boston as lately as the 1<span class="CharOverride-9">st</span> day of this month &amp; arriving at this city of Palaces upon the 25<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> having passed a week in England he could tell us of Aunt Winstanley who will scarcely expect Debo now.

When I look back upon Gods dealings with me they have indeed been such as to cause me to praise Him not only with my lips but in my life! &amp; shall I not devote my all on earth to Him, who hath so mercifully led me for forty years thro this wilderness. If He calls me from the joys of an earthly home Oh may it be to a heavenly Canaan! My heart clings too fondly to ties here. husband, children Mother! absent brothers, sisters &amp; a native land hold out strong inducements to make me yearn for many years! but I earnestly pray to have no will but as God wills &amp; that Jesus may be preferred to all other ties however deserving of my best affections. Have mercy on my human weakness Oh Thou who rememberest my frame! Let me lean on thy compassionate bosom &amp; cast my cares on Thee! Yesterday being the anniversary of the birth of my last little one, I almost hoped would have brought to my embrace the one expected this month. but every day is precious as I have duties for my hands yet to fulfil. We should strive more than we ordinarily do, not to neglect present time, “Tho in the midst of life we are in death”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-189-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-189">189</a></span></span> All that I attempt now has that awful import.

I only, <span class="CharOverride-1">envy</span> such, on earth, &amp; pray the habits I have endeavoured to give my children may become their choise thro the influence of Gods holy Spirit. Oh that they may value time as they ought! referring all their pursuits to Eternity! How inexcusable are those who avoid the means for improvement, I have read “James Anxious Enquirer”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-193-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-193">193</a></span></span> again lately with startling interest, &amp; today took up Abbotts “Religion &amp; Happiness”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-194-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-194">194</a></span> </span>wishing all I love might see the force of his arguments as I do. But my dear husband &amp; children understand my views as being simply those of the bible &amp; I pray they may live separate from the world, whether I am their companion &amp; encourager in the narrow path, or whether from the grave I speak to them. Now bodily pain makes me restless &amp; this may be my last page! I have just been drawn to the window overlooking the court, by Dounias expressions of admiration, my nerves are weak surely, for why should I weep as I gaze on my precious Debos graceful form as she is riding thro the Archway with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes &amp; his wifes Sister Emily Hall<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-195-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-195">195</a></span></span> they look so happy &amp; the weather is so propitious for their enjoyment, but the <span class="CharOverride-1">future</span> for that daughter presses heavily upon my heart if she should soon be left Motherless!</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">But let me not wish to “guide the hand of God, nor order the finger of the Almighty”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-196-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-196">196</a></span></span> What an oppressive burden is taken off a Christians shoulders, by the privilige of leaving all consequences <span class="CharOverride-1">while in the</span> path of duty, to God.

How solemnized were were feelings as I completed even that, for the pains of my body made life seem uncertain, but our Heavenly Father has indeed given a fresh spring to my earthly existence &amp; I pray for His grace to spend it in bringing my children up in His service. At about half past one oclock on friday morning August 29<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>our little darling Russian boy was born,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-198-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-198">198</a></span></span> his fond father &amp; Aunt Alicia who had by turns comforted me by their presence in my chamber, waited in the nursery to see the fine healthy babe put in his Karita<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-199-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-199">199</a></span></span> by Naanooshka,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-200-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-200">200</a></span></span> soon after which our dear Debo &amp; George were told of the acquisition, the latter only, expressed dissappointment that it was not a little Sister, as to James &amp; Willie, another little brother was just what they wanted! Willie was so captivated he would fain have attached himself to Titanias<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-201-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-201">201</a></span></span> apron string! &amp; always thought it a great treat if he might have the glass of mothers milk which baby did not want, or a reward if allowed to see him in his Karita. Every hour testified Gods goodness to me. D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Handysides<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-202-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-202">202</a></span></span> visits seemed only to be to advise caution to keep well &amp; to congratulate me upon having so vigorous an infant. Titania was called to Alexandrofski to fulfil her engagement to my American friend<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-203-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-203">203</a></span></span> when baby was eight days old &amp; it has been my pleasure every morning since to bathe &amp; dress my sweet boy. but when she was a fortnight old she was permitted to come to see him &amp; to be present at his christening,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-204-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-204">204</a></span></span> which took place in our drawing room in presence of all our American friends &amp; was performed by D<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> Law, (my Sister Alicia &amp; George being Sponsors while Whistler stood proxy for our pastor the Rev<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƚ</span> H Lee of Springfield Massachusetts who we think will not object to being God father to our little John Bouttatz. Yes we have named him in compliment to our Russian friend Col Bouttatz, for he has evinced love towards our other children &amp; must ever be associated with those (God early recalled) Kirkie (who loved him for his gentle attention, &amp; Charlie whom he was the last to look upon! Probably he may never see this name sake! for he is thousands of versts away, engaged in some mines on the borders of China in this vast Empire.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-205-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-205">205</a></span></span> tho if he ever can visit us I am sure he will love the little Johnnie who is such a delight to us all. That Sunday of the christening being the 3<span class="CharOverride-9">rd</span> after his birth I sat at the head of the dinner table – but I ought not to omit to mention all our domestics<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-206-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-206">206</a></span></span> were witnesses, &amp; each drank his health &amp; tasted to rich cake offered to our guests. Yohon our faithful German footman who is a Lutheran. Christina &amp; Doonia our laundress &amp; house maid who are Russians &amp; therefore of the Greek church &amp; Marie our cook a Fin, each seemed equally interested, tho our own good Mary shed tears of emotion, for she as having been Charlies nurse &amp; now Johnnies feels most with us. May He who was in the midst of us, Accept this little one &amp; regenerate him by the purifying influences of His holy Spirit &amp; may we his parents fulfil our vows to work with God &amp; strive to keep this lamb of Christs flock from straying away from the fold! Gladly do I renounce the vanities of the world! Oh may God help me to obtain a conquest over my own sinful passions that my example may not be a stumbling block to any of those entrusted to my care. May I never forget they are not <span class="CharOverride-1">my own</span>, but Christs, &amp; to be required at my hands! Awful responsibility. The next day was one of some bustle &amp; I avoided it by keeping to my room, for I must store up all my energies for the demand in prospect. It had suddenly been decided that we must part from our dear Debo whose health needed a change &amp; Mary was aiding her in packing for a long absence from home, we must none of us selfishly murmur, for God had marked out our course of duty. As last June every effort she made to set out for England was frustrated, so at this time every obstacle was removed &amp; on tuesday she embarked with her kind Aunt Alicia &amp; her brother George on board the Rob Roy for Hull,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-207-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-207">207</a></span></span> the agent of which had so considerately restored her passage money when he heard that our plan of sending her in June was frustrated by Georges visit to Russia I bore up against my grief at parting with three at once, not only for their example but for my dear husbands sake, &amp; would it not have been sinful to have had rebellious wishes, when an Invisible &amp; Heavenly Parents hand had the helm. “for without Him not a sparrow falleth”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-208-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-208">208</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>Whistler took our boys to Cronstadt to see their Sister, Aunt &amp; brother on board the English Steamer. So many arrangements were requisite to be completed that day in preparation of the new Tutors coming the next, that Mary with Doonia &amp; Yohon were all busy, I only gave orders as I sat beside &amp; attended to my baby. We required no dinner except in the kitchen! But tho I was well pleased to have had our appartments restored to perfect order &amp; many comforts concentrated in the two rooms<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-209-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-209">209</a></span></span> to us for sleeping, I realized how desolate the circle when at nine in the evening my dear husband &amp; boys returned &amp; we four sat down to tea, where the table was wont to be crowded. That night Whistler &amp; I were still seated in earnest conversation about our darling daughter until after midnight, he had spent some sleepless ones in the prospect of this necessity for a separation from her &amp; it became my comfort to soothe &amp; cheer him by sympathy &amp; by leading him to cast his care upon Him who could make all which seemed adverse work together for good to her. Mons Lamartine<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-210-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-210">210</a></span></span> was installed on the 18<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> of Sept<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-211-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-211">211</a></span></span> as Tutor to James &amp; Willie. I rather dreaded heading my own table the first day while my husband was at Alexandrofski, as I could not converse with a German &amp; he had I knew lived two years in the family of Gen<span class="CharOverride-9">l</span> Chiffkin, whose lady<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-212-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-212">212</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>of course could freely do the honors, as Russ Italian &amp; French she is equally versed in, however as there was no resource I collected all my mental powers &amp; went out to welcome him as one of our family circle, he came forward with the utmost politeness &amp; respect, kissed my hand, &amp; the freedom with which my boys chatted with their tutor soon made me quite comfortable. I could comprehend – &amp; this was enough for it is difficult to determine which is the greatest talker Jemmie or Mons Lamartine, he is about fifty years of age - yet perhaps his sallow &amp; very thin visage makes him look so, for his black hair is not the least turned. He takes all his meals at our table, only his lodging is at the house where old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon has hers, she recommended him to us, &amp; so grateful is he that once when she was out he took the chance of testifying his gratitude by spreading a handsome quilt upon her bed which he had purchased purposely. One excellent trait in his character is his affection for his Mother who is supported from his salary, he looks sad when he speaks of the improbability of his ever visiting home again! he seems truly pious, attends his - the Lutheran - church regularly every Sunday morning &amp; would always join our family prayers as he has done once or twice but like most people on this continent is not fond of early rising! he only manages to catch his breakfast with us. At 12 precisely Yohon takes him a cup of Soup &amp; each of the boys a boiled egg to the Cabinet d’etude at 1 1/2 they go out to walk, great has been the demand for patience &amp; perseverance with the tutor until they are broke of their wild pranks in the school &amp; on the street, he must indeed discover a vast difference between them &amp; Russian lads who are drilled from infancy to politeness &amp; submission</p>

She is looking forward to our dear friend Kate Prince meeting her in Preston! May He who is the hearing of prayer answer mine for the happiness of my dear daughter! cheer her during her trying separation from us &amp; turn all that seems adverse to her wishes into cause for gratitude hereafter, May He unite our hearts perpetually in love to Jesus &amp; grant that we may always remember in passing thro temporal scenes, the end of being that we may enjoy them only as pilgrims upon earth, referring all things to Eternity. May my dear daughter only seek friends among those who are the friends of Jesus! In England she has the advantage of hearing from our native land speedily &amp; keeping up a regular correspondence with dear George &amp; Julia. She will open the mysterious pacquet I put sealed in her trunk containing her birth day souvenir &amp; tho trifling in comparison to last 24<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>of October, it will tell her mother <span class="CharOverride-1">thinks</span> of her.</p>

How many events for gratitude to God crowd for notice. Our dear Georges letter announcing his landing in New York reached us exactly three weeks after its date! the most prompt communication yet, between the U S &amp; Russia. During the Steamer G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Britian’s<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-219-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-219">219</a></span></span> voyage thither George was exposed to great peril, once this immense ship was surrounded by breakers among Nantucket shoals, the experience he has had even since he left us ought to excite trust in an Almighty, invisible hand which led them out of their perilous situation to the haven where they would be - for Debo had acknowledged how fearfully near, death seemed on the boisterous voyage they made to England. Oh how she would have trembled again could she have been aware how the sea raged around her dear brother! but she was spared even hearing of the uneasiness felt for the safety of the G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Britian - as this was only her 2<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span> trip to N York &amp; she was 19 days accomplishing it - We have heard lately from our dear daughter how glad she was made by a letter from George – she had just returned to Preston after having spent a fortnight at Waterloo,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-220-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-220">220</a></span></span> where she had gained so much strength from sea air that she had explored its environs on foot or Donkey without suffering fatigue. Kate Prince was still in Paris! and Aunt Alicia had remained in Liverpool. Debo missed her as a part of home, notwithstanding the fondness lavished on her by Aunt Eliza &amp; that she is a favorite of Uncle W. They mention the death of our old friend M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƨ</span> Stevenson<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-221-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-221">221</a></span></span> in London. for many years she had been tried with illness &amp; afflictions. Oh that thro much suffering she may have entered glory! she was one who lived but to serve those around her! May it be said unto her at the day of Judgement “inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of these - ye did it unto Me”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-222-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-222">222</a></span></span> but I have heard nothing of her death except that it was <span class="CharOverride-1">sudden</span> at last.

As I seated myself at breakfast table what was my surprise to find under my cup a beautiful gift from my faithful nurse Mary, a carved ivory seal for my desk with the initials of my name in silver &amp; a type of her own fidelity in the chaste cart dog at the top. I was moved almost to tears by her humility in placing it for my acceptance &amp; the boys were not slow to report to her after breakfast that “father said he never could find any thing so pretty” when they went to give her a large bun &amp; to distribute one to Yohon, Hadenskougg, Dunia, Coharka, Christine &amp; Coacher.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-234-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-234">234</a></span></span> Willie could not in two turns bring the load from the German bakers,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-235-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-235">235</a></span></span> without aid, &amp; his labour of love created much mirth in the bufet. After babys bath I was soon ready to take the boys a drive in our beautiful new Sledge, we called at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Woods to invite his children to dinner the next day. tho our first stop had been at Madame Zagoshkins for her two little girls,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-236-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-236">236</a></span></span> who attended by their nurse were at our house by the time my boys could get dressed to receive their guests, but these were not allowed to stay more than two hours. I am guilty of repetition I find from seizing odd moments after days intervening. For we have entered upon a New Year 1846. And never was there lovelier weather than Thursday the 1<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span> of Jan. Our boys were to have spent it with their young countrymen the Eastwicks<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-237-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-237">237</a></span></span> upon the American Ice Hills at Alexandrofski but Jemmie had been imprudent in venturing upon the Skating ground before it was freed from snow without overshoes, also be it recorded to his disgrace he had run thro every pile of new fallen snow which had been scraped together by the sweepers on the English quai. he paid severely for his exploits by narrowly escaping Croup &amp; he was asked if going thro the Allegahany Mountains<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-238-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-238">238</a></span></span> was preferable to the ice hills – As he poor fellow had to keep his bed the New Years day I stole Willie from the school room to go to the market with me having yet the Old Style Christmas<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-239-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-239">239</a></span></span> to prepare gifts for. how striking was the Winter scene as we went out upon the Quai. the sun shone so brightly upon the gilded spire of the Old Fortress Church on the opposite side of the frozen Neva, which is not yet soiled by the winters travel over it. We were altogether out two hours for after shopping two we came back to get dear father to help me choose new caps for the boys. very becoming they prove, of maroon col<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> velvet. he selected a Polka Hat<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-240-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-240">240</a></span></span> for himself, the boys thought it put him quite in a dancing mood when he went home! Another American mail without a line from George, if he could only conceive how dissappointed we feel he would not omit writing regularly. A letter from Mary Mac<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-241-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-241">241</a></span></span> informs us he is in Baltimore &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winans informs us it is in his fathers works our dear Son is interested.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-242-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-242">242</a></span></span> he should not have deputed to others this intelligence, for we look to him now for our medium of communication, since Julias<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-243-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-243">243</a></span></span> letters are directed to Debo in England, &amp; my dear Mother is in Florida for the Winter</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday [January] 5<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> Russian Christmas Eve.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-244-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-244">244</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>Willie looked so nice when Mary completed his simple toilette &amp; sent him by Coacher to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Morgans<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-245-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-245">245</a></span></span> at 6 oclock, with many charges not to disturb ringlets or plaited frill by his furs - and seemed so full of bright anticipations of all around the green tree, the little companions he was to frolicwith till 9 oclock that I felt more than ever sorry dear Jemmie’s cold still keeps him prisoner, and he so good humouredly saw Willie depart! only we disagreed about the advice he gave to fill his pockets full of bon bons – After our tea, Mons Lamartine being away, Jem &amp; I hied to the school which was in the nicest order for our setting the plates, my apron &amp; pocket filled with the gifts selected during my several shopping excursions of last week with my little Willie as interpreter in German. French or Russ as the various magazines<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-246-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-246">246</a></span></span> needed. We had to reserve dear fathers portion for when I might arrange the several articles in my own room as he soon followed us to the school room. We had just filled the plates eight in number when Willie returned from the party, he being the first to tear himself away from the facinating circle at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Morgan. which had been considerably increased by the entrance of masked ladies my innocent Will could scarcely believe Miss Emily Law was not a real Russian Nurze, tho he knew Miss L was not a Monk or Miss Isabel a Cossack<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-247-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-247">247</a></span></span> – he came home laden with spoils for it is the custom in this land to take all the bon bons one cannot eat &amp; those who are not au fait,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-248-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-248">248</a></span></span> have them pressed upon their pockets. The last thing attended to by our boys was hanging up their stockings &amp; Mary acted as a liberal Santa Clause, she would not again teaze them as she did New Style by putting in a bit of string &amp; an old end of a Sterine Candle. They were quite rich in the morning &amp; yeilded to my proposal not to open the door of the school room until after dinner. Willie hid the gift he had for dear father by his plate before breakfast &amp; after the blessing had been pronounced I pretended something called me to the Corridor &amp; softly stole behind Whistler with the new Umbrella open &amp; shaded his head, this caused the boys a merry moment &amp; then father discoved Jemmies tobacco box, which coming from the Demidoff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-249-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-249">249</a></span></span> is completely Russian. he declared we had all cheated him as he had supposed gifts were only provided for the servants &amp; he had none for any of us. But the boys did not agree to that when James found his watch converted into gold by fathers forethought &amp; Willie received a costly &amp; instructive game called the Gallery of Versailles<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-250-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-250">250</a></span></span> Johnnie we all claim as our richest New Years gift &amp; kisses is all we offer for his acceptance. Our Servants all were thankful to attend church as we did, Mary of course could not leave baby. D<span class="CharOverride-9">oct</span> Laws text was “Jesus Christ the righteous” some parts of it did not satisfy me. he wore his scarlet robes &amp; cap. altogether the effect was too high church for a simple republican.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-251-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-251">251</a></span></span> Many more communed than usual, I remarked for the first time our friend M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W Miller, yet very probably he has often received this sacrament without my being aware. I always now am irresistibly led to notice the Hon<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƙ</span><span class="CharOverride-9">e</span> M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Bloomfield<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-252-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-252">252</a></span></span> at church, since her piety is her distinguishing grace. she is sweetly devout and I should judge her unaffected &amp; humble minded. What a contrast to the gay, worldly, old Lady Stewart who occupied her place when we first came to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburgh I was pleased that only my dear husband &amp; boys waited dinner for me, as the servants were the sooner freed from attendance, Yohon took the contents of his Christmas plate home to gladden his children, &amp; Coacher asked to take his pie to share it with his brother, he promised to send the 3 ruble note to his wife who is a slave<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-253-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-253">253</a></span></span> in Moscow. The three women servants would kiss even Whistlers hand when the came up to the drawing room to receive their plate &amp; dresses. As to baby the nearly devoured him with kisses. Mary had to run off with him to the nursery. she said she had never before such beautiful gifts. I felt so happy that I had succeeded in gratifying all I asked for no greater treat. Our tutor did not get his gifts till yesterday the 8<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>as he has been sick. Hadenskougg seemed equally delighted with his. &amp; Even Pasha<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-254-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-254">254</a></span></span> had a mince pie. How easy it is to create good will among those who are not pampered &amp; selfish. I had quite depended upon a Christmas offering from my dear Debos pen &amp; was dissappointed when the envelope contained only a hurried note from her to her father &amp; the others directed to friends here, she has spoiled me by the regular &amp; fond epistle once every fortnight, for tho I was glad to get a note from our dear Kate Prince - who also sent one to each of our boys,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-255-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-255">255</a></span></span> I craved more. I had forgotten to mention that of late I have had to pay several visits to our countryman Doct Maynard,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-256-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-256">256</a></span></span> he has almost charmed away my dread of a dentists chair by his skill &amp; gentleness, even in the fearful operation of extracting. I did not suppose I could voluntarily have submitted to losing three teeth, as I have done at a sitting lately. This countryman of our dined with us today en famille as did M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Harrison &amp; Annie unexpectedly. We had one of my mince pies, for the first time since leaving Springfield I ventured in the kitchen to try my skill as a pastry cook, but alas want of practise caused labour without satisfaction. I wished these might meet others who at our table<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-257-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-257">257</a></span></span> tomorrow. but they are always welcome even when I am not prepared to show off my best house keeping.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Friday evening [January] 9<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-258-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-258">258</a></span></span> My husband had engaged to take M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Curtis<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-259-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-259">259</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>&amp; his daughter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-260-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-260">260</a></span></span> to the Alexandrofski works but the snow was yet falling in heavy flakes as it has done this winter &amp; they decided to wait for more favorable weather. We invited our good neighbours the Ropes to meet them at our five oclock dinner but M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> R had not a moment to spare from poor Hannahs<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-261-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-261">261</a></span></span> sick room &amp; also her three little girls are quite ill with cold, how various are the scenes of this uncertain life. Whistler &amp; I took our little Willy to church yesterday to attend the funeral service of our old landlord M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ơ</span> Drury,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-262-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-262">262</a></span></span> he was so deeply interested he wished (as we drove back thro the Galernia, many times we might to go to the grave, he had noticed the grief of even the poor slaves who were present when their old masters coffin was moved down the aisle &amp; said how solemn it looked to see the little grand children weeping &amp; all the family in deep mourning. I shared my little Willies feelings &amp; it was rather an effort for me on returning home to bustle about getting fruit &amp;c ready for our expected dinner party. Col Todd was the first to make his appearance so we had some private chat in the drawing room upon the Presidents Message<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-263-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-263">263</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>&amp; the Cols own contemplated return to our native land,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-264-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-264">264</a></span></span> before M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Clay came, with an apology from his lady<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-265-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-265">265</a></span></span> whom he left in bed. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Joseph Ropes was quite an acquisition, for M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƶ</span> Curtis<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-266-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-266">266</a></span></span> were the only two besides. the dinner was a nice one &amp; all passed off well to my relief. We had Codfish which is brought from Archangel<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-267-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-267">267</a></span></span> frozen &amp; we had also American cider the gift of my kind friend M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gellibrand. but it was not from Newark<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-268-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-268">268</a></span></span> I fancy. A bright moonlight night &amp; the report of a thaw, which with such an unusual quantity of snow was not desirable. We sent the Curtis to Misses Bensons lodgings in our sledge at eleven, the others had taken leave before tea. the col having two other engagements for the evening. It is always a weight off my mind when a dinner party is over whether as an entertainer or a guest, I prefer unceremonious hospitality.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">March 9<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> 1846.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-269-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-269">269</a></span></span> Monday night. I should give up journalizing as it is so seldom I have an hour not demanded by some higher duty. but hope always urges me on, there may come a time when I can make weekly records at least, &amp; if we ever return to our native land my boys may like to refer to this period of their sojourn in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg. The weather this winter has not been as it was last year. Thro Dec we had much rain &amp; the river was unusually late in closing. January was frost unyeilding till at last we became accustomed to 20 deg of cold &amp; upwards. truly I realized the old adage in February “as the days lengthen the cold strengthens”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-270-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-270">270</a></span></span> and we each have suffered in turn. I have taken cold after cold, my husband also from exposure in his drives to Alexandrofsky has had repeated attacks, and once our precious baby was so ill I wept over him trembling to see him suffer, but God blessed the means used &amp; since then he has been gaining upon our little countryman “Sweet William”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-271-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-271">271</a></span></span> next door &amp; does not yeild the palm for sprightliness to any of the babies of his age. The frosty weather yeilded very mal a-propos no doubt the people thought, for the thaw began with the Carnival, nevertheless the crowd thronged all the places of amusement in the Square &amp; when we drove home that way one day - week before last - from a shopping excursion in the Nevsky the Circus riders were trying to entice the multitude to pay &amp; enter. Jemie felt quite tempted by the 1/2 doz riders who had come out to shew their horsemanship, &amp; wondered I could resist the invitation but I always reply to my boys that the Spectacle for us is outside, where the holiday scene tho painful to reflective minds, certainly is peculiar to Russia, the ice hills in the centre with their sledges in active business. the gaily painted pavilions some offering swings, others boats <span class="CharOverride-1">on</span> <span class="CharOverride-1">wheels</span>. others cars on a circular rail way. then the theatres with all their tawdry signs, at a signal all are set in motion together &amp; the poor people fancy themselves happy while they chaunt their own peculiar measures, tho the Police are surrounding them on their huge black horses to make them remember they must keep their mirth within bounds in this Imperial city. This holiday when none will work who can avoid, commences on the Lords day &amp; is kept up thro another Sabbath immediately preceding Lent. Indeed the whole community are rife for amusement before the fast. The theatres, concerts &amp; Operas offering three times instead of once in the day. Our boys found it so tantalizing when the Eastwicks came from Alexandrofsky to our house purposely to take them to the Cachels<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-272-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-272">272</a></span></span> that I almost feared their father would yeild, but the most <span class="CharOverride-1">unselfish</span> feelings induced him to say nay. they had always been happy without these <span class="CharOverride-1">experiments</span> &amp; he would not risk their following the multitude in their chase after folly. It was kindly meant by the Eastwicks &amp; I rejoiced on reflection that my dear boys seemed convinced by their fathers arguments, they should have had a course upon the Neva in the Laplanders sledges<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-273-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-273">273</a></span></span> drawn by Reindeer Whistler went to seek this seasonable pastime for them, but for that day the races were over, so he sent Yohon to secure for them seats at the Theatre des Enfants<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-274-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-274">274</a></span></span> for the morrow. Mary went with them. it was noon &amp; I gladly took her post in the nursery. when my dear boys came back by 3-oclock &amp; Willie acted all the little poupéts parts, sung, danced, disappeared to come again before me with fresh novelties, I felt that few could enjoy more innocent amusement than we. he so artlessly said to me when describing the scenery stage &amp;c “Oh Mother it all looked so grand I was afraid <span class="CharOverride-1">real</span> people would come out to act &amp; then I knew we ought not to stay as you do not approve of any but poupéts acting” – I wished within my heart he might ever make this distinction &amp; never have the sin recorded against him of encouraging immortal beings in thus frittering away their days in rehearsals &amp; their nights in exhibitions! Jemie was in extacies when he told me of the beautiful dissolving views which had closed the exhibition &amp; they had each said to Mary as they drove thro the Square, how glad they were that father had not let them break the rules to go in that <span class="CharOverride-1">rowdy</span> crowd. Even poor Dounia our Russian maid tho the boys had each presented her a half silv ruble to amuse her Sat afternoon at the Cachels had not gone, she spent her money in coffee &amp; sugar &amp; congratulated herself that she had not yeilded to the temptation to throw it away upon Swinging &amp;c. Our coachman got drunk without leave or licence, but he was the only one of our household who heeded the general holiday. My dear husband who has often dieted during the winter to get rid of illness was obliged to consult doct R &amp; it happed <span class="CharOverride-1">luckily</span> as some would say, but <span class="CharOverride-1">providentially</span> his setting out for an inspection of his rail=road had been delayed for he would have been as badly off as Mungo Park.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-275-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-275">275</a></span></span> I had little sleep while he was ill for baby too was yet in a precarious state &amp; probably anxiety for them both, aided by the closeness of our heated house affected my heat,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-276-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-276">276</a></span></span> then the preparations for Whistlers departure exposed me to draughts for last Sunday week<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-277-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-277">277</a></span></span> which was the day succeeding, I was scarcely able to open my eyes from congestion of the brain. I immediately directed my attentive Mary to apply synapisms<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-278-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-278">278</a></span></span> to my ankles, back of my neck &amp; throat. and took a dose of oil, by noon however I sent for the doct who approved of my course &amp; only advised a mustard foot bath, but darling Johnies teeth caused me a sleepless night &amp; I realized the next morning how ill I still continued. however during the week which has elapsed I have gradually recovered. letters from dear George in Balt came to divert attention from self – &amp; others to enclose his father to meet him at Tver.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-279-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-279">279</a></span></span> also one from Debo<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-280-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-280">280</a></span></span> to interest me. she writes of the signs of spring coming violets &amp; crocuses opening &amp; of her walking miles without fatigue. how great her advantages to be where her feet can press the soil! but she only is eager to fulfil her term of absence from home &amp; be restored to us again. I cast the future upon the Lord who so gently leads her &amp; warms hearts to love her wherever she is. thanks be to Him that her health is restored, I will not even dread bringing her back to the unwholesome atmosphere of this city founded on a bog-for He has ordered our sojourn in it. The thaw has now lasted nearly a fortnight, it would be imprudent for me to walk, I even rode the trifling distance to church last Sunday, it was Sacrament &amp; I took dear old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon home in our sledge tho her lodging is such a step from the church, but she must have waded ankle deep in mud to get thro their gateway.

I was surprised as delightful<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-292-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-292">292</a></span></span> last evening to have my scribbling put a stop to by my husbands unexpected return home, he found the travelling better than I had anticipated for him, had not felt well, but had gone all the road to Moscow, where he attended divine Service last Sunday, he came back upon the grand chemin<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-293-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-293">293</a></span></span> which from the expectation that the Emperor would soon travel to Moscow<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-294-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-294">294</a></span></span> was in fine order, many hundred peasants constantly labouring to keep it smooth. And here I will note what Whistler has seen in Summer, women &amp; children weeding this turnpike lest his Imperial Majesty, or the Count K’s eyes should be offended by a weed or any grass peeping out of the gravel My dear husband had not forgotten us in his fortnights absence, for each of the boys he brought a gun which Yohon is to teach them how to use, they had merited rewards for good conduct &amp; I was delighted to see them so. Mary’s gift a screw cushion<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-295-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-295">295</a></span></span> was just what she had wished for &amp; the pretty hand bell the only thing I was not already supplied with. What a holiday it causes throughout the house when father comes home! of course much bustle too. I have been very busy in unpacking. Whistler had taken a canister of cakes to make presents at some of the officers house where he is always hospitably entertained, but the ingredient of butter condemned them &amp; he brought them back. I sent one large loaf to the kitchen for the Fin Cook &amp; laundress do not <span class="CharOverride-1">substitute</span> or fast as they call the Lent regimen. I gave the other to Yohon to take home tomorrow to his wife &amp; children, for Lutherans also are quite exempt from the six weeks abstinence, tho of course as in our church this is a holy season in theirs.

And this month past I have been much occupied in a sick room. My dear husband was seized by such an alarming attack a few days after his return from the road that altho all doct Rogers skill was exercised, we found nothing to remove the excruciating pain for many days warm applications yeilded relief, &amp; my unceasing activity was demanded by night &amp; by day to repeat the poultices often enough. how thankful I felt that he had not been taken so very ill away from his nurse &amp; physician, and how grateful when at last he could take nourishment &amp; sleep! While the rumours of sickness &amp; death were on all sides, we were spared. Oh that we might improve our prolonged existence here to the glory of God &amp; the benefit of that part of our being which cannot die! baby was dangerously ill after his fathers convalescence &amp; doct R was only surprised that I did not complain of fatigue from watching one sick couch then another, when I could be dispensed with my symptoms shewed a deranged system &amp; I have feared I should suffer the debility many complain of here after the long confinement to heated rooms. My dear husband was sufficiently recovered to go <span class="CharOverride-1">for us both</span> to the dinner party our friends the Gellibrands gave to the Americans.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-297-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-297">297</a></span></span> but I was still too unwell last Wednesday, to accompany him to another, next door<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-298-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-298">298</a></span></span> where he met them, W<span class="CharOverride-9U">m</span> Maingay, the Meirrilees &amp; several other English friends. How far it was from the thoughts of any them assembled around M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes hospitable board that the youngest &amp; most blooming among them would this day be deposited in the tomb, yet difficult as it is to realize, we have listened this morning to the funeral address which M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Ellerby made at the American Chapel over the coffin of this young christian, and my prayer is that the impression may be deep &amp; lasting. It is just a week today since Emily Hall<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-299-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-299">299</a></span></span> in the bloom of health apparently sat for M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Wright<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-300-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-300">300</a></span></span> to take her portrait, the family never put off what may be done in good time &amp; her return to England so soon as the navigation might be free being urged by her parents &amp; sister<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-301-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-301">301</a></span></span> at Leeds, her fond Sister here wished to secure a likeness of her favorite Emily at least. tho they were all hoping now the Neva’s ice was dissappearing they might remove to Pavloski early enough for her to participate in Summer scenes in Russia as she had so much enjoyed the peculiarities of its Winter pleasures. The Ice Hills she was quite a heroine there! and sledging she had compared to flying so exhilarating she found these exercises is the pure cold clear atmosphere. she likewise enjoyed exceedingly going to the Ménage<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-302-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-302">302</a></span></span> attended by her brother-in-law, who always must ride on horse back for health – last friday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-303-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-303">303</a></span></span> they were in the quadrille of Equestrians! she the admired of the set for the ease with which she managed her steed, &amp; he so proud of his Sister Emily! After dinner he proposed walking with her to the Gostinandvor to shew her the curious spectacle of the toy booths &amp; the immense crowd collected to sell &amp; buy trifles, for the Palm-market was a novelty to her, she expressed herself pleased as was her wont where she saw their desire to delight her, but in the evening confessed she was not well upon their noticing her pale cheek &amp; unusually quiet air, took some remidies for a cold &amp; went early to bed. last Saturday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-304-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-304">304</a></span></span> - the next morning - Emily was up in good time for family prayers &amp; to make breakfast for M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes, for the baby<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-305-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-305">305</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>&amp; little Ellen being ill, their mother was not allowed to make any exertion. When I stepped in just before our dinner time to ask after the little ones, I was struck with their kind Aunt Emilys paleness &amp; felt it unusual with her not to take part in the friendly chat with her sister &amp; myself, especially as we touched upon the subject of her return to England, for M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> R was fearing in six weeks she should not be able to finish the beautiful peice of embroidery, she had all winter been trying to complete for her Mother, but during the past nine months she remarked “we have never all been well! I always have some one to nurse!” Little Ellen then wished her Mama to stop working, take her on her knee &amp; read a story to her, upon which Aunt Emily put by her own embroidery &amp; soon Ellen was happy with her fond arms around her neck, who then began telling of having taken little Louisa to the drawing room windows that morning to see the ice floating down (the river having been released from its Wintry fetters in the night<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-306-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-306">306</a></span></span> – and she so fondly repeated all the untutored remarks of the little two year old neice, that love &amp; kindness was every tone, still I was pained by her strange look, &amp; when I heard towards evening that D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Handysides had prescribed for Miss Emily who had gone to bed I was not surprised, colds are still so prevalent &amp; I had found the Palm market a chilly place, I doubted not she was getting the Influenza. On Sunday morning when I sent in a supply of milk from our over abundant dairy<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-307-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-307">307</a></span></span> I sent a message also enquiring how all were, &amp; heard that Miss Emily was much better, therefore I made up my mind M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes would go to chapel &amp; so little serious did I consider her symptoms I should not have wondered had she gone also, for she never let trifling obstacles impede her attendance at the house of God. I had always been convinced of Emilys devotion to her Saviour, she had only a few days before been saying (happy as she felt visiting her dear Sister - she must go back to her charity &amp; Sunday schools at home) and I have observed her in all weathers tripping away to Chapel &amp; when she could she has rode for the 3<span class="CharOverride-9">rd</span> service to Alexandrofski. Knowing how sacredly the sabbath is observed by our neighbours I did not intrude, but thought Monday would be time enough! And yet I had not been without many experiences of “not knowing what a day might bring to pass”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-308-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-308">308</a></span></span> After our early tea I was reading aloud from Legh Richmonds family portraiture<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-309-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-309">309</a></span></span> to my boys &amp; their dear father in the drawing room, the front door is so near, we hear the voice of all who enter. A succession of quick pulls at the bell &amp; Elizabeth Ropes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-310-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-310">310</a></span></span> agitated tones made me spring to her side. “Oh come M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> W for Gods sake! the doct says Emily is dying! the short passage between our lodgings was passed in a moment &amp; I was not many seconds in reaching the chamber of death, for so it proved, the idolized girl of 19 years was gently breathing her last, with her loving face turned towards that fond Sister to whom she was never again to speak in this world! M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Ropes was kneeling on the bed beside her, gazing intensely upon that countenance which was so calm, she could not believe the cold hand she pressed was in the gripe of the king of terrors, but if the loved one were conscious the <span class="CharOverride-1">sting</span> of death was not felt by her, she might have been strengthened by Angels who were invisible to mortal eyes! for she slept in death, as an infant lulled to sleep in a mothers arms. The struggle had been no doubt some hours before when poor Emily was so restless they could keep on neither blisters or sinapisms, <span class="CharOverride-1">she had then</span> raised herself many times hopeless of ease &amp; fallen back again on her pillow exhausted. but from the time I stood by her death bed all was calm, &amp; dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes could not believe her darling Emily had ceased to breathe until she called for a candle &amp; saw her eyes glazed! sightless, tho open! then nature could sustain her fortitude no longer, she was carried in a swoon to the next room by her afflicted husband, who felt as keenly as herself losing their favorite Emily. who have recovered from that protracted &amp; severe illness of last Autumn, they were not prepared to give up in 30 hours from this sudden attack. “Be still and know that I am God”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-311-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-311">311</a></span></span> was not slow to reach their wounded hearts, &amp; tho so deeply bereaved, tho bowed to the earth in passing under this rod, they were not long in uttering “Gods will be done” Poor Hannah who had so tenderly been nursed by Miss Emily in her feeble health all winter, was so shocked by the suddeness of her death, she needed all our care &amp; support. Elizabeth Ropes &amp; I got her to bed only in time to keep her from falling in a fit on the floor, her whole frame shook till we feared dissolution &amp; her extremities we cold as Emilys! When at last she could find power to speak she said “Oh Why did not God take me! I am so miserable, so useless, such a care to every body, &amp; she was such a blessing to all! but then she added meekly “He knew who was best prepared for His summons! Oh that I may be as ready to go as Miss Emily was” —– But I must not prolong my account of last Sunday night, tho it was after twelve ere I could leave that house of mourning. Aided by my good Laundress &amp; my excellent Mary we dressed for the last time that cherished body that no rude hands should touch it, and a sofa having been placed hear the balcony in the drawing room, the double sash removed &amp; the fire put out, doct H. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Merrilees &amp; her Uncle Gellibrand bore the cold form of Emily which was extended on a board that it might be gently removed to its lonely couch. There both M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Gellibrand gazed upon the loved form tho the sister could not yet weep. but on the successive days her bursting heart was relieved by floods of tears, as she could not deny herself stealing to Emilys side, until tuesday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-312-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-312">312</a></span></span> afternoon, when after the doctors had examined into the cause of so sudden a death &amp; decided it was inflamation of the bowels.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-313-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-313">313</a></span></span> the body was put in its coffin (covered with pure white velvet - with plated handles &amp; silver plate with name, &amp; that evening carried to the Chapel. Dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes &amp; even poor Hannah were there at the service today. Old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon went with us, but neither of these were at the grave<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-314-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-314">314</a></span></span> itself as the distance &amp; weather rendered it imprudent. Never shall I forget what I felt as I stood looking down into that white sepulchre &amp; saw the earth sprinkled on that snow white coffin of the young Emily! but as her dear little neices have been taught to distinguish, so must we all bear in mind it is only the body of senseless clay in that beautiful coffin. the spirit has returned to God who lent it to cheer parents &amp; Sisters &amp; friends, and He will speak comfort to all who turn to Him. Tho clouds &amp; darkness surround His throne,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-315-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-315">315</a></span></span> we know that the beams of mercy &amp; love emanate from it. And that in all our sorrows, Jesus sympathises. What a lesson to the young to Remember their latter end<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-316-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-316">316</a></span></span> ere the days come in which they may not find repentance tho they would flatter themselves the sick bed is most suitable for making our peace with God. But when the body is racked with pain, the intellect becomes clouded, Emily did not need to make a death bed testimony that she was one of the Saviours fold, for His service had engaged all her talents, but alas if she had given the world her heart, how could she have commanded her affections to Him who is the Lord of all. her brain was so much affected immediately that she could not converse &amp; it was only by one remark in reply to her Sisters wish that Emily were well, &amp; she in her place that she gave any expression which would lead one to suppose she was aware of any danger “Oh Ellen dear she said, dont wish yourself in my place! think how much more valuable is your life than mine!” I have seen M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes since the funeral, she is calm &amp; has comfort in speaking of Emily, whose spirit she is assured is rejoicing in the presence of her Saviour, she trusts to His might to sustain her parents when the blow shall reach them. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes has written their pastor M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hamilton<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-317-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-317">317</a></span></span> at Leeds who imparted so much religious instruction to Emily, he will comfort them by sympathy &amp; sustain them by the promises of Gods word. I cannot cease writing of Emily Hall whom I never saw till eight months ago, without touching upon her sweet influence over her little neices next door. their parents have always been intent upon training them in the way Jesus teaches us to bring up our children even in the nurture &amp; admonition of the Lord. the obedience &amp; dutiful attention to their parents wishes is a sufficient reward for their perseverance. And their Aunt Emily these few months past has added greatly to their heavenly wisdom by seizing every favorable hour for cultivating their love of music, with spiritual songs &amp; strengthening their memories with appropriate verses from the bible to their childlike confidence in a heavenly Fathers goodness &amp; love. They have spent every day since her death at our house. Ellen who is just five years old has such a subdued tone &amp; looks so sad, when she says “it is so very strange! the Aunt Emily who is upon the sofa in the drawing room, is not at all like the Aunt Emily who was always with us in our rooms! and then as if prompted by some invisible monitor she adds “Oh but it is not Aunt Emily! it is only her body that is upon the sofa, her soul has gone to God &amp; she is happier in heaven, than we are on Earth”. Little darling Mary Emily sings “Around the throne of God in heaven thousands of children are”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-318-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-318">318</a></span></span> and when I ask her who taught her that, she says in a solemn tone “Aunt Emily but she cannot speak to me any more!” then she brightens up &amp; adds but Aunt Emily is happier than we are! she is with Jesus &amp; she tunes her harp &amp; sings with the children there! Oh how pleasant that hymn sounds now that she taught me to sing!” Then she goes on in the same strain. “God wishes us all to go to heaven when we die! He says “Those that seek me <span class="CharOverride-1">Early</span> shall find me”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-319-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-319">319</a></span></span> and Jesus says “Suffer the little children to come unto me &amp; forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-320-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-320">320</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>Oh would that all would use their opportunities as did this Young Christian! who was so unostentatiously a devoted servant to the Lord. “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speak”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-321-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-321">321</a></span></span> And how natural it is to speak of those we think most of! And how strange that the world should impose such restraint upon the theme of all others to inspire the heart eloquently to speak. “Whosoever honoreth Me before men, him will I honor before the Angels of heaven”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-322-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-322">322</a></span></span> Oh if we realized more fully, that we are but pilgrims our stay here uncertain, we should not put off, repentance, &amp; amendment of life.</p>

The only April showers here are frozen, indeed the extreme cold of Winter is not so trying to the constitution as the chilling winds we have had this week. I was highly gratified however at the Academy, should like to take some of the Russian scenes so faithfully portrayed,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-326-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-326">326</a></span></span> to shew in my native land, my James had described a boys portrait<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-327-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-327">327</a></span></span> said to be <span class="CharOverride-1">his likeness</span> &amp; altho the eyes were black &amp; the curls darker than his, we found it so like him! his father said he should be glad to buy it, but its frame would only correspond with the furniture of a palace, being a rich vine, the boy is taken in a white shirt with crimped frill open at the throat, it is half length &amp; no other garment could set off the glow on the brunette complexion so finely. But I gazed with a deeper interest upon a large painting of Bruno’s<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-328-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-328">328</a></span></span> “the Serpent in the wilderness”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-329-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-329">329</a></span></span> those countenances beaming with Faith I should never tire looking at, &amp; Oh what a gloomy contrast do those make who will not look &amp; be saved! Almost every afternoon lately dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes comes in to sit with me in my room whilst her husband is on Change, she says to sit alone now, where Emily was ever at her side quite unfits her for the exertions duty to her family require, she talks continually of her to me &amp; says since Emilys sudden death, the world has lost its charm, whatever does not lead to Gods glory or advance the interests of immortal souls she now thinks ought not to be indulged in, herself &amp; husband repeat to each other not to delay the performance of good, “<span class="CharOverride-1">tomorrow</span> we may be in another world”</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday evening May 9<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> If my writing had not been interrupted last Saturday I should have recorded that the last Boston mail had brought us more letters than we have ever received at any one time from our dear native land, what a treat! my head &amp; my heart were both full of news &amp; emotion. I wished in vain for leisure to answer all by last tuesdays<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-330-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-330">330</a></span></span> mail, could only finish one to my dear Sister Kate &amp; enclose within it a note to Eliza M<span class="CharOverride-9">c </span>N.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-331-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-331">331</a></span></span> how beautiful the account my precious mother wrote me from Florida under date of Feb.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-332-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-332">332</a></span></span> of the approach of spring after an unusually cold winter in that latitude “Charlies house surrounded by daily rose bushes, now in full bloom, Olianders &amp; cape Jessamines also, multiflora woodbine &amp; yellow jessamines covering the piazzas” all these so odoriferous how enviable to have with reach, it was no wonder I had a sweet dream of my mother after she had filled my fancy thus, it was a brief deception but it made me happy to have been near her even in a dream.

May our heavenly father bless the dear inmates with health to enjoy house keeping again!

Day before yesterday the weather changed, the snow which had continued up to then I hope may not return, baby has so enjoyed being taken to walk twice a day by his never wearying nurse Mary! she says he notices objects so much he all but speaks! looks in her face so smiling as he gazes at the novelties in the Boulevard,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-344-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-344">344</a></span></span> or on the Neva as she strolls with him on the English Quai. I have felt new vigour from the walks I have had directly after breakfast with my dear husband, we cross the bridge &amp; continue our promenade by the river on the Vasili Ostrow side up to the Custom house<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-345-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-345">345</a></span></span> &amp; back. The birds &amp; flowers it is supposed will soon be filling the court yard there, as the ships now just arrived at Cronstadt are transporting these favors for the public market by lighters<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-346-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-346">346</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>from that seaport to this Imperial city.

I hope the coming dry season may arrest the illness which fills the hospitals yet to overflowing. No doubt we shall soon be complaining of dust! which is a great annoyance whenever winters pavement is removed. I observed a little green grass today in my drive with boys &amp; fancied the naked trees looking ready to bud, we shall soon jump into Summer! Next Wednesday will be May-day old style &amp; all the world must hie to Catrinoff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-349-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-349">349</a></span></span> tho there will not be a green leaf to regale the eye; But I had intended as I alluded to sickness among the poor especially to record an act of mercy &amp; justice too in the Emperor as it was repeated to me by my old friend M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> L. his majesty was making his annual visits among the hospitals as is his custom to inspect all the public institutions, he observed many sick, miserable objects-seated on the steps whom he learned had been refused a shelter- why? the hospital was full &amp; fifties were disappointed daily. the Emperor was struck with the injustice to the poor that suites of fine large airy apartments were yet retained by the heads of the department, he promptly issued orders for the necessary arrangement of bed for the sick in these which had been mere audience chambers for the rich or general visiters. My old friend also told me with great satisfaction the impositions which the new Governer of the city<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-350-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-350">350</a></span></span> is redressing. he goes about disguised as a poor person to purchase meat or other commodities &amp; whenever he finds prices exhorbitant condemns the butcher, baker or shop keeper to a suspension of business &amp; sometimes demands a heavy fine. But my husband step demands my welcome!</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Friday 8 oclock in the evening May 22<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span> Our tea table waits Whistlers coming &amp; as the sun is still quite bright I may write a bit ere my boys are ready to hear me read as usual on their retiring. I get very slowly on in the delightful book a Scottish mission to the Jews<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-351-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-351">351</a></span></span> which to me is so interesting from my having read M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span>Cheynes life<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-352-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-352">352</a></span></span> last Summer, but I prefer enjoying it with my dear boys &amp; Mary in the nursery, tho the long day-light beguiles them into cheating me of the hour I used to devote at their bed side to sacred biography or scriptural readings. We have had very cold weather until these two past days, &amp; for want of rain dust has been in plentiful circulation when the wind rose, my darling baby nevertheless has gathered a blooming complexion &amp; good appetite from his airings. Mary daily takes him out ere the blustering of Boreas<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-353-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-353">353</a></span></span> can impede his enjoyment. While I gaze at him with delightful feelings, &amp; my grateful heart is lifted to God in acknowledgement of His goodness to me undeserving as I am—. my sympathies are not withheld from a bereaved neighbour, whose little one just eight weeks older than my Johnie far exceded him in intelligence, &amp; who was quite as remarkable for health, the first ten months of her life none had lost an hours rest with care of her, &amp; she had never lost a meal, her four first teeth had appeared without warning, but it was Gods will that teething should be cause of such a train of disease to remove her to a better world in less than a fortnight. Yesterday I saw the precious little body in its pure white coffin, flowers strewed around it, how unavailing its being so cherished by its fond Parents &amp; Sister, it could be kept no longer &amp; the lid was screwed down that they might bear it to the tomb. last Saturday at midnight the redeemed spirit had been borne to the bosom of its Saviour, &amp; when on Monday I went with M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes to weep with dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> M.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-354-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-354">354</a></span></span> we found her quite resigned, she had been attempting taking its miniature. She had been most afflicted at witnessing its sufferings, but with the Man after Gods own heart<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-355-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-355">355</a></span></span> felt after death it could not come back to her, the hope of going to where her little one is will always sooth her as she weeps her loss. In the death of an infant a mother feels “the joy of grief”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-356-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-356">356</a></span></span> Last sunday morning the announcement of M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> M-s bereavement revived my feelings in my last trial, &amp; my mind was deeply solemnized for attendance at Church. I was surprised to see a stranger in clerical dress follow our pastors family to their pew. Doct Law read the service &amp; Doct Wiley<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-357-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-357">357</a></span></span> I (afterwards learned was his name) preached, a man past the prime of life with a slight scotch accent, but his very reverential manner &amp; deep toned voice made every word impressive &amp; his subject was fitted to raise our views to the Eternal Three in One! <span class="CharOverride-9">17 </span>Chapter, latter part of the 12<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> verse of S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> John.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-358-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-358">358</a></span></span> his attitude fixed attention as he leaned forward with a small bible in his hand, if he had notes he scarcely referred to them. I am afraid I shall not hear him preach again, as it is said he is making only a flying visit to his brother Sir James W &amp; that he feels he ought not to absent himself from his flock in Scotland. he came over by the Hull Steamer had morning &amp; evening worship on board &amp; explained the scripture daily to the passengers &amp; crew. I must not omit to record the arrival of our friend George Prince from Boston last Saturday, he returned with the same Capt. Leach - with whom he went out to his native land last August. he was accompanied by his brother,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-359-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-359">359</a></span></span> they three with the Ropes &amp; our friend Capt Kruyger took tea<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-360-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-360">360</a></span></span> with us on Monday last, Whistler &amp; I received some letters from home by M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Prince, who whenever he can be spared from the Counting house comes in to regale us with anecdotes of all our relatives &amp; friends whom he visited<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-361-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-361">361</a></span></span> in the course of his nine months absence.

M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> M has sent me a dress, &amp; to my boys a bundle of Stuarts candy,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-364-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-364">364</a></span></span> how very kind &amp; flattering.

We called upon old M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Baird on our return, she was very glad to see us &amp; invited me to stay to tea, she expects Miss Morgans Sister<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-372-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-372">372</a></span></span> from Scotland every day &amp; is in high spirits at the prospect.

Old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon who has been very poorly, was well enough to spend day before yesterday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-376-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-376">376</a></span></span> with me. doct Rogers came to tea by chance &amp; we have had M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Prince to breakfast &amp; tea when M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes could take his horse back ride to the Datcha to pass the night, for I have begged our young countryman to come with out ceremony when threatened with a solitary meal. Yesterday the Empress of all the Russias was welcomed back to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-377-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-377">377</a></span></span>there was a grand service performed at the Kasan church at which all the Imperial family were present crimson cloth spread on the pavement for the beloved Empress to walk from her equipage to the church, crowds waited to see her features once more both at the church door &amp; Palace.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-378-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-378">378</a></span></span> Last night the illumination which my boys have been so eagerly expecting took place, I stationed myself beside baby to let Mary &amp; Dounia each witness what young people like, the glare, &amp; was so interested in writing to America while Johnie slept that ten oclock surprised me, it was half after when Mary brought Willie to undress him, but James expressed such an eager desire that I should allow him to be my escort just to take a peep up the Nevski that I could not deny him. The effect of the lights from Vasili Ostrow was very beautiful, as we drove along the Quai &amp; the flowers &amp; decorations of large mansions close to ours I thought more tasteful than those in the Nevski. We had to fall into the line of carriages in the Isaacs square to enter that broadway &amp; just then the shout from the populace (so unusual in this city) announced to us that the Empress was passing. the cloudy evening was not so favorable for seeing her face, as it was for the illumination, but no mistaking that there was her very Imperial self from the two Cossacks as footmen, as none but the Empress boasts of those proud attendants,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-379-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-379">379</a></span></span> her guards also were in the rear. thus the Empress was going home to the Winter Palace just as we were beginning our dissipation. but there was no possibility of getting out of the line, gen d’armes stationed thro the middle of the Nevski, prevented any disorder, tho I was terrified lest the poles from the coaches should run into our backs, or that some horse might take fright, or bite us so close were their heads. Jemie laughed heartily &amp; aloud at my timidity, he behaved like a man, with one arm he gaurded me &amp; with the other kept the animals at a proper distance. I must confess, brilliant tho the spectacle was <span class="CharOverride-1">my</span> great pleasure was derived from the conduct of my dear &amp; manly boy.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-380-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-380">380</a></span></span> he was not the least sleepy when we reached home at one oclock in the morning, tho I had nodded more than once. I can just recollect my pleasure when a child of ten years viewing the illumination in the city of N York when peace between my country &amp; Gt Britian was announced<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-381-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-381">381</a></span></span> &amp; this is the only one I have seen to compare yet with that, for usually in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg the illuminations attend every marriage &amp; christening in the Imperial family, it is merely the name, for cups of oil on the pavement scattered at distances &amp; even that miserable attempt is early extinguished, but on this occasion of the Empre’ss return, the initials of her own &amp; the Emperors blazed forth with crowns, wreaths &amp;c<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-382-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-382">382</a></span></span></p>

Crowds of people have been flocking since early this morning by the Steamers to Peterhoff, yesterday on our return from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gellibrands Datcha where we spent a delightful day, we met equipages without number thronging thither, many of them court carriages from the scarlet liveries we knew, &amp; some few of the Corp Diplomatique by the green feather in the cocked hat, loads of chairs, mattres’s &amp; such kinds of conveniences, besides one or two fire companies with hose, for watering the gardens. <span class="CharOverride-1">We</span> wished they could have laid the dust of the Chauseé, for notwithstanding all the rains - which continued every day until last Saturday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-385-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-385">385</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>- the Peterhoff road is such a highway for troops &amp; travellers it is seldom free from clouds of dust. Our friends the Gellibrands are charmingly situated, upon an estate<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-386-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-386">386</a></span></span> with several others, their house stands upon elevated ground far back from the road, from the front balconies the view of Gulf &amp; of this city in the distance is fine, we saw the gilded dome of the Isaacs church glittering in the bright sunshine. My two boys found much amusement in propelling themselves on the draw bridge to &amp; from the fancy island in the pond, then they bounded after butterflies among the wild flowers, feeling it such a treat to be free in the country! darling Johnie also was as gay as a bird &amp; won much admiration upon his intelligence &amp; sweetness, contrasted by Willie Ropes my baby indeed looks like the country child &amp; that little pale faced one as though he had been shut up in town, the three little girls have much benefitted by their range at their kind Aunts who told me the only alloy to their perfect enjoyment was, there was a parting in early prospect, for M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> R<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-387-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-387">387</a></span></span> must soon take her children to England! thus it is in this world we must ever have something to sigh for. I told my boys as we seated ourselves at tea in our own home last night I thought they had not even enjoyed the commemoration of our 4<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ </span>of July last Saturday as much as their country range. but they would not admit that any place in Russia was as pleasant as Alexandrofski with all the Eastwick boys to play with! then the percussion caps, fire works, cross bows &amp; muskets, the rides on horse back &amp;c yeilded so much excitement &amp; variety! Willie forgot how sadly he burnt his hand &amp; came home roaring with agony &amp; tho to me no drive is so disagreable as that to Alexandrofsky, thronged as the road is with beggers &amp; drunkards, and the village has no sweet secluded spot but the little garden enclosing our countrymens home, I can imagine my boys see none of the annoyances, for they anticipate the warm welcome of youthful Americans &amp; the kind indulgence of their parents in lending horses &amp; grooms to secure them a safe &amp; healthful pastime. I have so long neglected my journal that I have yet to record the introduction we have had within the past fortnight<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-388-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-388">388</a></span></span> to American clergymen,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-389-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-389">389</a></span></span> accompanied by a young lawyer named Beach from Newark New Jersey.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-390-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-390">390</a></span></span> knowing my friends there is has been very delightful to entertain them all.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-391-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-391">391</a></span></span> the younger of the divines M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Rankin<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-392-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-392">392</a></span></span> I have not yet heard preach but hope to when the return from Moscow, they have been obliged to leave behind one of their party (Rev Rob<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Baird<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-393-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-393">393</a></span></span> who has been so ill from Rheumatism since arriving here, he has been secluded,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-394-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-394">394</a></span></span> but it is a cause of thankfulness he is with kind M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Wilson who keeps an English boarding house in the Galernia<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-395-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-395">395</a></span></span> very near us, this clergyman from having visited S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P years before is not as a stranger,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-396-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-396">396</a></span></span> I hope to see this countryman who as advocate in the Temperance cause has had interviews with several of the crowned heads of Europe.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-397-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-397">397</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>I felt it to be a high privilige to hear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Brinsmade<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-398-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-398">398</a></span></span> both morning &amp; afternoon of the sunday before last. I was in a pew with eleven Americans at the American Chapel in this city in the morning &amp; took my boys to Alexandrofski where “an upper chamber” is consecrated at the American works, to divine worship,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-399-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-399">399</a></span></span> it was so entirely filled that even the window sills were in requisition as seats. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> B took his text from the beautiful book of Daniel 5<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> chap &amp; latter part of the 23<span class="CharOverride-9U">rd</span> verse,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-400-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-400">400</a></span></span> I felt the subject to be well chosen. for how few of us remember to glorify the Lord our God in our several stations. the solemn, kind manner of the preacher made his solemn subject very impressive, he discoursed upon the invisible hand which had led us so far from our native land &amp; prayed for the aid of the Holy Spirit to sustain us in shewing forth true religion in our intercourse with foreigners. I lost none of the high respect which M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> B had won from me in the pulpit when he came with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Rankin &amp; Beach to dine in our family circle last tuesday,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-401-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-401">401</a></span></span> the blessing he asked upon our meal was in the same strain, realizing the providence which had brought us, strangers in a foreign land to the same board! How good for us it is to be reminded to trace every event to our Heavenly Fathers direction! I hope to be strengthened by the pious counsel of these my countrymen by going to hear them again tho I seldom desert my own church even to attend the American Chapel. unless it be to contribute my mite to a missionary collection, for in the English chapel we never hear of Missions, for our benevolent pastor doct Law is restrained by the Factory<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-402-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-402">402</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>- who maintain this branch of their countrys establishment &amp; he has been governed by them 25 years. but as far as his own exertions extend he goes about doing good. what a deplorable loss, neither sunday school, bible class, or missionary society connected with our church here! I must think the Dissenting congregation of the American chapel true followers of Christ for they are zealous in the cause of spreading the gospel, why should we deem ourselves only, of the true faith, I shall never forsake the beautiful forms of the Episcopal, with its perfect prayer book yet I cannot be so bigotted as to think the service of other sincere christians less acceptable to the Saviour, merely because their order is not that I have been educated to like best. But now I think I ought to commence a reply to letters from my dear Debo which we received by yesterdays<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-403-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-403">403</a></span></span> mail that mine may be ready for next Sat<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-404-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-404">404</a></span></span> - Courier, she was at Blackpool, with our sweet young friend Eliza Smith,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-405-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-405">405</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>I half hope M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Harrison may join them in sea bathing, but she was ill in London lodgings by the same date, the physician says it is only debility, when she can gain an appetite she will regain her strength, I shall cheer her by the pleasant reports I can send of her home &amp; infant my God daughter as I have fulfilled my promise of going often to Alexandrofski to see the little Alicia. Debo will be interested to hear what is circulated about preparations for the approaching wedding of the G<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> Duchess Olga. I have happened at Francescas<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-406-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-406">406</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>to see some of the bridal paraphanalia &amp; heard from her that on the 28<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> old style which will be next Friday all her outfit will be exhibited at the Palace at Peterhoff, her jewels, clothing, furniture, even to kitchen utensils–<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-407-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-407">407</a></span></span> I am afraid I shall not see it, as 30 versts is a long way to go for a peep. I lately saw at Francescas an infants wardrobe for a lady at court, from its Valenciennes christening cap, its embroidered french cambric robe lined with pink satin, to its dozen Paadooshkas<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-408-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-408">408</a></span></span> - or long wadded pillow upon which it is carried - its pillow cases all of french worked cambric, &amp; the one upon which it is to be carried to the font very rich &amp; lined with pink satin. The Héritier is to be its God father as the father of the yet unborn babe is one of his aids.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-409-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-409">409</a></span></span> The whole is to cost 3000 silver rubles, I had not the slightest wish for one article, &amp; my Willie who was with me seemed to think the baby could not be lovelier than his little brother, who is always in simple white frocks, but the order for all this from the rich, is a benefit to the poor who must thus earn their bread &amp; I rejoiced for the amiable Francisca, who politely asked if my little commission for M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Eastwick could wait till after the Imperial wedding- “we are so busy for our Grand Duchess” she said. This girl is a perfect lady in her address &amp; deportment, she has been well educated by her Aunt to whom I was recommended by dear old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon – she speaks English elegantly &amp; therefore I must believe she is as well versed in French. Russ &amp; German as she is familiar with all. What an advantage, I could almost envy her. We have been favored lately with many letters from the United States, bringing relief to our anxieties respecting the war with Mexico, from Gen Taylors<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-410-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-410">410</a></span></span> victories. I gladly welcomed a letter from my friend Meg Hill,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-411-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-411">411</a></span></span> which was commenced last November &amp; finished in May, she has the faculty of transporting me to the midst of her family circle &amp; regales me with reports of others My former &amp; very favorite pastor M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Lee of Springfield was in the city of N York upon the occasion of the consecration of “old mother Trinity”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-412-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-412">412</a></span></span> And M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ballard<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-413-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-413">413</a></span></span> of Pittsfield whose sympathy upon the death of my sainted little Kirkie has made any association of his name interesting. Oh only those so far from their native land as I am, can judge how welcome the sound of familiar names in scenes from home.

			<p class="Body-Text">Tuesday July 2<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span>/14<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-415-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-415">415</a></span></span> Several anniversaries in my own family circle the last week gave me occasions for deep but silent reflection. the public rejoicings on the occasions of the Grand Duchess Olga have demanded my participating in my childrens interest in the several spectacles. It is a week today since the Betrothal,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-416-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-416">416</a></span></span> at Peterhoff, it is said some superstitious fear made the fair fiancée object to the ceremonies being solemnized in the chapel of the Winter Palace, the associations of her Sisters nuptials, &amp; death following within the same year are too sad, for this happy occassion. they do say she shed many tears at her betrothal at the thought of how soon she must be separated by it, from the Empress &amp; all which the spring time of life has endeared to her. The affection throughout the family circle of the Emperor is well attested. Still as Olga is fond of the Prince of Wurtemberg–who is her Cousin as well as lover, it is said her Imperial parents are well satisfied to establish her thus<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-417-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-417">417</a></span></span> &amp; if rumour whispers truly she may soon be crowned queen, as the father of her lover is talked of as being on his death bed.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-418-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-418">418</a></span></span> Since our arrival in Russia the annual fête in honor of the Empress names day has been omitted, therefore this had a higher zest &amp; was selected also as the wedding day of the beautiful Grand Duchess Olga.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-419-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-419">419</a></span></span> With the exception of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Clay our Chargé probably no American was witness to the ceremony in the chapel except the Rev<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> Rob<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Baird, whom the Prince of Oldenburg had invited to his palace in his zeal for the Temperance cause &amp; complimented him by providing a place for him to witness the Imperial marriage.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-420-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-420">420</a></span></span> while we Whistlers accompanied by our new acquaintances from New York the Crufts,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-421-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-421">421</a></span></span> with the Harrisons &amp; Eastwick families were jostled about in the crowd. tho the thousands there were as we have always observed in Russia extremely decorous &amp; quiet. it was computed at least 200.000 people were in the garden last night, &amp; from the throng on board the Steam boats<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-422-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-422">422</a></span></span> from early in the morning that calculation must have been within bounds. Whistler was afraid to risk his precious cargo among them &amp; decided to hire a carriage &amp; four, which I grieved to have to pay 24 silver rubs for one night, however we we<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-423-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-423">423</a></span></span> thought to be fortunate to get any, as almost every vehicle had been engaged &amp; many had pd 30 &amp; 35 silv rubs the road was not dusty, for showers have been incessant. The G<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> Duchess may argue favorably from the “remarkable coincidence”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-424-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-424">424</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>that the only two bright days we have had this month past, were last tuesday her betrothal – &amp; yesterday. We thought last night the moonlight not too light for the illumination, so many trees, some in dense avenues covered with lamps, the green foliage contrasted beautifully with their brilliancy. I wish I could convey the faintest idea even of the magnificence of the spectacle, it was truly Imperial. it is said the Emperor has appropriated an additional 20.000 silv rubles to the cost allotted to illumination other years, &amp; this has been the first time the upper garden<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-425-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-425">425</a></span></span> - close to the Palace &amp; fronting it - has been lighted, at the entrance gate from the town was a crown &amp; under it very conspicuous O.K. for Olga &amp; Karl, &amp; the gate looked as if composed of diamonds. but all the rest of the upper garden had coloured lamps in the shape of fruits &amp; flowers, bands of musicians were stationed in the groves &amp; played alternately. The lower garden which is very extensive even to the Gulf - is descended to by a long flight of steps. the fountains rival those at Versailles, a golden Statue of Sampson which is placed where the largest body of water is played is worthy of its celebrity, the young New Yorkers of our party were glad to have their curiosity gratified by seeing the Sampson they had heard lately so much of: lines of illuminated wall looking like filagree work of gold &amp; diamonds (for in the lower garden were no colored lamps) formed avenues extending in different directions thro, the principal one from the palace had at the end near the gulf, what looked like an immense gate of brilliants, surmounted by a blazing sun the rays of which enclosed an A for Alexandra in honor to the adored Empress. It was expected the Imperial family &amp; court would have passed thro the illuminated avenues in open cars - similar to Irish cars<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-426-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-426">426</a></span></span> in form - as is usual on the Empres’s day to gratify the <span class="CharOverride-1">Mobility</span>,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-427-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-427">427</a></span></span> who like to see them in all their magnificence but we learned that they had about 7 oclock left the Palace with new married pair to seek the quiet of a more retired dwelling. I commended them for their feeling. &amp; were I one of the Grand Duchess Olgas train should pray she might retain such habits &amp; ever be indulged in them. The Imperial family left ladies &amp; gents of the Court to represent them in the ball room &amp; in the balconies. I saw some sign of merriment as tho the fancied the vulgar crowd hoaxed, &amp; soon as possible we extricated ourselves for a purer atmosphere. I had shuddered to find the coarse beard of a Mujic<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-428-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-428">428</a></span></span> close to my cheek &amp; his breath of leeks &amp; vod-kee almost made me sick. but every variety mingled in that crowd, ladies in the most costly dresses of satin, gauze &amp; silver, were contrasted by the odd home spun finery of Fin peasant-girls - very like our native Indians. And sheep skin coats no matter how old or greasy rubbed against gold lace in regimentals without fear, for on these occasions of fêtes the poorest subjects of the Emperor forget the shackles &amp; revel with perfect freedom. Refreshments to suit all grades were to be obtained throughout the grounds, Mujics would meet us offering their “Harosky”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-429-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-429">429</a></span></span> drinks &amp; eatables, but we killed two birds with one stone by seeking Islers<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-430-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-430">430</a></span></span> tent for tea, as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Eastwick had promised to meet us there with our boys, our party was rather numerous we were continually getting separated by the crowd, it reminded me of the story of Jack &amp; his eleven brothers,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-431-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-431">431</a></span></span> for we had each to compare notes of adventures when we met at the OK which was always our trysting if an hour kept us asunder &amp; there we were sure always to find our faithful footman Yohon, he would make a circuit &amp; come back for orders to the point true to Whistlers appointment. My regret is that our good Mary who merits every indulgence cannot find a suitable escort to go one of these three nights to Peterhoff. I should far rather have had her take my place in the carriage &amp; I keep her station at home beside my darling baby, but M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Crufts &amp; her Sisters<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-432-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-432">432</a></span></span> I had promised to be with, besides my boys are now too large to be tied to Marys side &amp; she would have felt awkward unless as their attendant. James has begged me hard to let him be Marys escort tonight but 30 versts off is a great distance &amp; we cannot trust Mary to those boats where the multitude seem to tempt God by their reckless carelessness about life. Perhaps another year Mary may go to a Peterhoff<span class="CharOverride-1" lang="ar-SA"> fête, even Christina &amp; </span>Dounia have been prudent enough to yeild to the unpropitious weather &amp; stay at home, tho I had given them leave to go. Mary &amp; baby were sent off early yesterday to Gellibrands datcha where they had a charming country range with Hannah<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-433-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-433">433</a></span></span> &amp; the children of dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes. we stopped there as it is half way on the road to Peterhoff &amp; took coffee with our friends. it seemed such an age to be separated from baby since the morning, it was delightful to see the darling so happy &amp; behaving so admirably. he was in his own nursery again by seven &amp; when we returned from the fête at 3 oclock he had only awakened once. I nursed &amp; put him back in his crib, ere I realized how weary of the nights dissipation I felt.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday 27<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of July<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-434-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-434">434</a></span></span> We have had a continuance of sultry weather since this month came in, yet my dear James caught cold from the dews at the Peterhoff<span class="CharOverride-1" lang="ar-SA"> fête, lassitude, loss of appetite </span>were the symptoms &amp; such an inflamed throat, leeches were applied &amp; consequent confinement to his room. Mons Lamartine who is always hypocondrical, chose that week to be too ill to teach tho he came to his meals &amp; I observed no strong tests of his feeling sick, still as vacations are general now, Whistler decided that our lazy Domini should be free &amp; I have had my boys so entirely upon my hands as to find little leisure. Our drawing room &amp; my chamber also upon the quai - for I have been obliged to move again to it for babys sake the noise in the yard having disturbed his slumbers - we spend our mornings in reading drawing &amp;c, then the boys take their row under Yohons wing across the Neva to the swimming bath,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-435-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-435">435</a></span></span> &amp; in the cool of the afternoon a drive to the Islands or a range in the Summer gardens, or a row on the river. It is an imperious duty that I should go with them, as the season for freedom in the open air is so precious. We went last Wednesday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-436-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-436">436</a></span></span> 15 versts in all the heat &amp; dust, for the after recompense of spending the day at the kind Gellibrands datcha. I soon lost all traces of having passed thro the furnace when seated beside dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> G in her deliciously cool parlor but my boys could not bear the confinement, the boat &amp; the drawbridge &amp; the Island below the lawn looked too tempting. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Ropes beguiled them just before dinner to join us by teaching them the moves of chess, but Willie deserted &amp; upon our being seated at table I was mortified that M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> G should wait so long in vain for him to be present at the asking a blessing upon the bounties spread. he was led in my the footman who had been sent to look for him &amp; he looked heated as any Pyrisvostic,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-437-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-437">437</a></span></span> from the like occupation, <span class="CharOverride-1">rowing</span>. Oh my boys when will you acquire a taste for playing gentlemen! While my kind hostess &amp; I were chatting over our coffee in the balcony we observed much excitement at the theatre of their mornings disgrace &amp; my wild boys were again in difficulty. I took the baby &amp; sent Mary to join the party of M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span>Ropes &amp; her children to look after James &amp; Willie. they had broken the ropes by which the drawbridge was drawn to &amp; from the Island &amp; there were my brave boys prisoners. I thought it best they should remain so till time for me to return home with such unruly ones, but the good natured Dvanic was already pressed into their service and swimming to their rescue ere I could run down to offer my advice. Jemie was so drenched with perspiration from his efforts, that dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes stole him away to her room to coax him to lie down awhile &amp; to rub him dry lest his sore throat should return to tell a tale of disobedience at home. Our Coachman had betaken himself to a rest in the woods &amp; was not to be found when I sent at 7 oclock to order the carriage, so Mary had a cozey tea with Hannah, and the gents reached home from the city &amp; we were so urged to tea &amp; strawberries that I yeilded, as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> R assured me I should not find my husband at home. And sure enough he did not get back from Alexandrofski till all but myself had gone to rest. He reported the heat overpowering in town &amp; at the works, and we had escaped it by going to the country. Certainly if the reign of Summer was not so brief one would be wrong to stay in town. Last thursday there was a grand celebration of the Grand duchess Olgas birth day at the Alargon.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-438-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-438">438</a></span></span> I gladly gave Mary permission to take the modest Francesca in our carriage with herself &amp; the boys. while I staid at home to be devoted to baby. We had had many showers during the day &amp; much dread there was that fire works would be “no go” &amp; they proved not so fine in consequence of the damp atmosphere. Whistler had decided to stay with me, but officers came from Col K<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-439-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-439">439</a></span></span> urging him to avail of a government barge with its many oars. I had the honor of making tea for them &amp; as all the maids had gone, Yohon played nurse after he had arranged the table for me to preside. It was one oclock when my husband return, to congratulate me that I had not been exposed to the risk of drowning from the crowd of boats upon the Little Neva,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-440-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-440">440</a></span></span> he was heartily tired &amp; wondered how he could have been so caught, we were both anxious till the boys &amp; Mary arrived, she said she should never ask to go in another crowd! when for an hour they had alighted to obtain on foot a better view of the fire works than they could in the carriage, gay officers had annoyed herself &amp; Francesca, &amp; my innocent Mary concluded they could not be gentlemen of principle! James had protected them as well as he was able, but she had felt frightened &amp; was so glad to get safe home! tho they had seen all the Imperial family within arms length, as they stood near the Palace, while the Emperor, Empress &amp;c alighted from their pony chaises to enter it. the young Prince Oscar of Sweden<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-441-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-441">441</a></span></span> a handsome youth of 18 was among the court. and many other foreigners who were wedding guests. This morning while my boys were taking their walk before breakfast with Mary &amp; baby they saw some tokens of another grand illumination to take place this week at Peterhoff, a government steamer laden with devices, lamps &amp;c, tempted them to ask the Bootishnic,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-442-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-442">442</a></span></span> who reported it was to be in honor of the Prince of Wurtembergs birth day!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-443-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-443">443</a></span></span> but I will not be coaxed into countenancing any more folly, my boys have seen enough &amp; must be content now to take amusement by daylight. I know it cannot be safe for our immortal interests that time &amp; mind should be so wasted that the order of nature should be so altered. turning night into day &amp; day into night, my boys did not take their breakfast till noon on friday!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-444-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-444">444</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>this is surely not keeping the straight &amp; narrow way”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-445-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-445">445</a></span></span> On Saturday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-446-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-446">446</a></span></span> as I was striving to make up for all the irregularities of last week - for I have not recorded my day spent in change of apartments, nor the guests I had to entertain at dinner &amp; tea several times - I was at the end of the week trembling lest my letters to my dear Mother &amp; Maria should not be finished for Sat. mail, when Dounia summoned me to the drawing room to welcome Miss M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span>Master<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-447-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-447">447</a></span></span> who is so deserving of attention, that I would not let her know. how mal apros pos was her visit, iced mead refreshed her, but I trust it was not so prized by her as my cordial welcome, &amp; she soon made herself so much at home, that I gave her Sandlands poems<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-448-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-448">448</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>to read while I scribbled thro my oft before interrupted scrawls &amp; trust they will be received before this day next month by the two dearest to me in New York. Miss M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span> M talked playfully with James about his better application to study &amp; greater perseverance in cultivating his talent for drawing &amp; I trust her serious advice covered so charmingly by good-humour may be remembered by him, she invited us all to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Woods datcha for next Wednesday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-449-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-449">449</a></span></span> James &amp; Willie always enjoy visiting her pupils &amp; I am particularly fond of the society of the excellent governess. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Wood called for her at 3 oclock, she had come to town to bid M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> W<span class="CharOverride-9U">m</span> Handisides<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-450-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-450">450</a></span></span> farewell, upon her embarking for a home in Scotland this day.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-451-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-451">451</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Wood being in England, Miss M rarely comes to town. But I saw her at church yesterday between Kate &amp; Ellen,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-452-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-452">452</a></span></span> the weather had been so excessively hot that baby confined to the house by it lost his appetite so I thought it would not be breaking the Sabbath at 7 in the evening to take Mary &amp; the three a row up to the old Fortress,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-453-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-453">453</a></span></span> we landed &amp; went into the church for the double purpose of giving our oarsman time to rest &amp; that we might visit the tombs of the Emperors of Russia the Fortress bears the date of the age of improvement in this Empire for Peter the G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> was its founder. 1780. of course it is not old looking, fresh &amp; in perfect repair. many were visiting the church as ourselves. service was over as the Greeks begin at 6 oclock sat evening. We slipped a ten kopeck coin into the palm of the soldier, who gave us each a flower, from the fresh garlands daily strewn upon the coffin of the loved Grand Duchess Alexandra, two other coffins covered with velvet palls (as are all indeed in the church) within the railings appropriated to the present Emperors family shew that he had lost a young daughter &amp; a son<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-454-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-454">454</a></span></span> ere the bereavement of that young bride of 18, the summer before last. Our guide lifted the velvet pall from the coffin of the late Emperor Alexander to shew us the jewelled Orders &amp; how highly it was ornamented, as a specimen for all the others, for when we came to that of Peter the G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> &amp; Catherine the 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span> he told us it was the same. That of the G<span class="CharOverride-9">d </span>Duke Constantine (who ought to have been Emperor by right in place of this his brother now reigning over all the Russias)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-455-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-455">455</a></span></span> displayed two keys taken by him from Fortresses in the conquest of Poland.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-456-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-456">456</a></span></span> I will not note all my reflections upon the vanity of earthly greatness they would occur to any one who views this world as only a state of preparation for another. <span class="CharOverride-1">self conquests</span> only, are of enduring benefit, but one cannot help moralizing in contrasting the splendor of the court of Russia with the silent sepulchre of its Emperors. We enjoyed our quiet row home at sun set 9 oclock And now I have endeavoured to begin this week by redeeming the time lost the last, I arose at 6. after my toilette took “The poor mans morning portion”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-457-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-457">457</a></span></span> &amp; my bible to the balcony as the only quiet &amp; cool retreat. Yohon was busy preparing breakfast in the Stolola.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-458-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-458">458</a></span></span> waxers were cleaning the parquet of the drawing room. &amp; Whistler dressing in ours. One of my greatest privations in Russia is a closet for private devotion. I could envy those who have a chapel attached to their dwelling. But my heavenly Father ordained my sojourning in this land where display seems most thought of &amp; therefore no arrangement for privacy. &amp; he reads my hearty desires &amp; I trust will accept them, continue &amp; enlarge them that I may avail of every opportunity for communion with my Saviour. Since breakfast &amp; my attention to household duties my James drawing table has been next my writing desk &amp; he hard working to finish a dog before twelve. when Koritsky<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-459-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-459">459</a></span></span> came &amp; condemned it. Willie has been studying John Gilpin<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-460-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-460">460</a></span></span> to spout to Father who wishes to hear him speak his own language distinctly. A letter from our dearest Debo<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-461-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-461">461</a></span></span> just received, tells of her pleasant meeting with her cousin Mary Ironsides in Liverpool, &amp; brings us chagrin also because Kate Prince cannot come home when Debo does.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">August 12/24<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> Monday. It is about a week now since my dear Whistler set out with Count Klienmichel<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-462-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-462">462</a></span></span> to inspect the work on his rail road &amp; I have occupied myself so regularly about house hold affairs in the mornings &amp; have devoted my afternoons to taking excursions with my boys to reward them for their application to study, that my journal has been quite forgotten. We went to pass Saturday &amp; Sunday at the Gellibrand Datcha last friday afternoon<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-463-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-463">463</a></span></span> &amp; returned home to an 8 oclock breakfast today it is quite an era in my S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg life, as I never slept from home before &amp; ere I begin my routine of duties, I will try to record the few vanities of the past month. We have had the hottest summer ever known in Russia,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-464-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-464">464</a></span></span> -&amp; as in England- some violent thunder storms, I am sure we shall not soon forget the awful appearance of the sky last evening. kind Miss Funk<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-465-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-465">465</a></span></span> who now presides at the datcha (M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> G having gone to Travemunde for her health) made the tea, but she felt as we did, while the elements raged that it was as if God spoke to us &amp; that a sensation of awe would prevent our enjoyment of the repast. how unconsciously darling little Johnie played &amp; laughed thro it all &amp; at last fell asleep while Mary &amp; I sat watching the storm, looking to God for preservation &amp; carressing our little pet to divert poor Pheodocias<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-466-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-466">466</a></span></span> fears. The poor Russians are superstitious they cannot feel that security in calling upon their Saints while crossing themselves, which prayer &amp; trust in Jesus inspires the bible christian with. It is only for our Redeemers sake we are spared to repentance. we feel as if there was but one step indeed between us and death, in a violent thunder storm! That of yesterday changed the state of the atmosphere From 24 deg heat in the shade Rom - today the thermometer is 13. I was uneasy lest James should catch cold during our drive before breakfast, but he &amp; Willie drove M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Princes droshky by turns &amp; the excitement kept him warm. I shall always retain a sweet impression of this Sabbath in the country however. the showers we had very early in the morning were immediately absorbed by the bright sun &amp; the young folks took a stroll after breakfast then came in to study hymns &amp; Collects<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-467-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-467">467</a></span></span> until eleven oclock when our neighbours from the Parsonage,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-468-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-468">468</a></span></span> &amp; an English governess in a Russian family<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-469-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-469">469</a></span></span> gladly joined us in our private worship.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-470-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-470">470</a></span></span> the prayers of our church were selected, two beautiful hymns &amp; a Sermons of Blunts “The Lord is my shepherd” was read by M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Prince. The children begged to be permitted a free range thro the woods before dinner &amp; under the care of Sarah Meeiriellees &amp; the neice of our pastors wife<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-471-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-471">471</a></span></span> we entrusted the two little Handiside girls &amp; my boys. Miss Funk &amp; I walked across to the next estate where M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ellerby has a summer retreat, we saw her three darling little girls, the baby about the age of mine is beautiful, as they are all lately returned from a visit to England<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-472-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-472">472</a></span></span> they are pictures of health, their mother is just what a clergymans wife should be, so interested in the spread of the gospel, so good to the poor, so cheerful, &amp; so accessible. I had a most interesting conversation with her about the state of religion in her native land &amp; such an interesting account of a converted Jew she had seen at South port.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-473-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-473">473</a></span></span> Of course Mr Ellerby was in town at his chapel, but to return this day to their sweet retreat for the week. We had again service in the afternoon which M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƨ</span>E attended. she had staid away to let her English nurse<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-474-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-474">474</a></span></span> have the privilige in the morning. Miss Funk &amp; I had just returned from visiting a poor German man<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-475-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-475">475</a></span></span> in the last stage of consumption. I thought of him during the storm when his shed could not have sheltered him from the torrent of rain, his bed only a bundle of hay! Oh that God may be leading him thro illness &amp; privation to a house not made with hands! he seemed so patient, so uncomplaining, so different from a common pauper, for when we gave him money, he discovered so much emotion &amp; apologized as the tears ran down his face <span class="CharOverride-1">for his necessities,</span> I sent my boys on our return to see him, wishing them to take a lesson in contentment by comparing their lot with his, &amp; Miss Funk wished that fruit &amp; jelly should go, so they could present it, as the Dvanic spoke only Russ.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">It was last tuesday morning<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-476-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-476">476</a></span></span> early my husband left home, in the afternoon I told James &amp; Willie they might go in the Omnibus<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-477-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-477">477</a></span></span> to Alexandrofsky to spend a few hours &amp; I should follow with Mary &amp; baby en droshky. the heat was intense, they had already gone to swim, when we arrived at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Eastwicks &amp; afterwards rode on Winans ponies, as all their countrymen were off on excursions. for it was a great holiday, tho we were not the least aware of its being the fête or day for blessing the Apples<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-478-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-478">478</a></span></span> until we encountered crowds of idlers &amp; I am grieved to add, not a few so intoxicated that their boon companions were carrying them, or they were like swine wallowing along the road side, I wonder when I witness so much intemperance upon these church holidays, how the powers that be, can approve of them. but alas vodkee is so profitable for the revenue, they cannot yeild their gain for the cause of temperance. I wonder what report my countryman Robt Baird will make at the Temperance society meeting in London<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-479-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-479">479</a></span></span> as to Russia! he has only lately gone from this city to that. I must not omit the record of Miss Caroline Laws marriage to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Rich<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> Miller,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-480-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-480">480</a></span></span> it took place last monday at the church 7 oclock p.m. Willie watched the carriages from our balcony as they collected on the quai &amp; was half tempted to run down &amp; make a friend of the Sexton that he might witness the ceremony, but could not induce Jemie to accompany him. the next day<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-481-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-481">481</a></span></span> a huge slice of wedding cake was sent me with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Millers card. I shall not open it till Debo comes, as she would have been brides-maid had she been here. The young couple met me the next evening<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-482-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-482">482</a></span></span> as I was leaving the Cars at Tsarskoe Selo with James &amp; Willie, our friend Geo Prince our guide upon our expedition to the Palace. We afterwards heard that the bride &amp; groom thus escaped attending a ball given at D<span class="CharOverride-9">oct</span> Laws datcha, by going quietly by themselves to listen to the music in the gardens at Pavloski. We only said how dye do to them for our time was limited from four oclock until tea time, it is not possible to convey an idea to any one in a republican country of the neatness &amp; order &amp; quiet in the little town of Tsarskoe. from the depot, thro the town up to the Imperial Parks nothing seems out of place, peasants are continually sweeping, weeding, watering even the roads &amp; in the parks even the faded leaves if within reach are carefully removed. As we had on former visits gone thro the Catherine Palace built by the consort of Peter the G<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʈ</span> which like all her works is rich in gilding, &amp; ornament,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-483-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-483">483</a></span></span> we chose the other end of the grounds &amp; alighted from our Droshkys at the gate nearest the new Palace,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-484-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-484">484</a></span></span> which the present Emperor resides in when there, tho since the death of his daughter the bride of the Prince Hesse Castle of Denmark, summer before last, his family have only occasionally visited this once favorite retreat, the soldier told us the Emperor oftenest is there, the Empres’s grief is revived by scenes where he loved daughter’s life ebbed away, yet she has been twice to gaze on the beautiful Statue of Alexandra with her newborn infant in her arms. it is of pure white marble, the figure is full length, the countenance preserves the likeness to the lovely face, we were told this “Parmetnic” or, remembrancer, was taken from that of the Princess Charlotte of Wales at Windsor. wrapped in a sheet, it looks like a blessed spirit ready to join those who walk in white around the throne of the Lamb. “Thy will be done” is the motto in Sclavonin above the statue, &amp; on each side of the richly sculptored arch are tablets with verses from the Gospel, “Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted” &amp;c. there is a pavement of black marble enclosed by a slight black railing the gate of which was locked, &amp; the most choice exotics as if growing out of the black marble wall which supports the railing, a pale lilac lilly which grows in rich clusters, &amp; which I never saw before, roses &amp; other flowers in full bloom, the pots were embedded in the stone &amp; mosses hid them completely.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-485-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-485">485</a></span></span> I thought the motto we read under a simple portrait of the loved daughter (in a Swiss Cottage<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-486-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-486">486</a></span></span> which is in the same bower of dark ever greens as the Statue) how verified by all the care &amp; taste bestowed by the Emperor. it is in french &amp; thus I translate it “I know Father you are never so pleased as when you can make pleasure for Mama” the picture looked as if it had been taken when the Grand duchess was in joyous girlhood. On this spot where this cottage (furnished à la Swiss is built) she used to stand at the head of the artificial lake to feed the Swans. she continued to do so the soldier told us even the last Summer of her life until she became too ill to go out. I admired the taste which had lilies of the valley planted in circles around the evergreens on this hallowed spot, it is hid from public view so that if any of the Imperial family are there at any time none can intrude to gaze. yet when they are not there, visiters are made welcome. We found no hesitation when we reached the palace to being admitted there by the officer in waiting &amp; were immediately taken to the Empre’ss apartments, the lamented daughter occupied those between her parents, &amp; the space which contained the bed she died upon has been converted into a sanctum for private devotion,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-487-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-487">487</a></span></span> it has been enclosed by a wall which is beautifully painted &amp; on the side where stood the head of the bed is the picture painted by Bruloff, so like her in life &amp; health, tho taken after death as representing her spirit passing upwards to the “palace above the blue sky.” she wears her imperial robes with a crown upon her head, at the back of the crown is a halo of glory. the stars are surrounding her as she passes thro them. No wonder my Jemie should have thought this picture of Bruloffs the most interesting of all the works of art around us. A most magnificent candle stick of gold with wreaths of wrought silver vines covering. stands in front of the portrait that a perpetual light may be burning as before the picture of saints in the Greek church, &amp; on each side of the portrait are pictures, of the Saviour, the Madona &amp; Saints. a most splendid tiara of real diamonds encircle the head of the Virgin &amp; child. I felt sadness as I realized the danger there was for the bereaved Empress to make an idol of the picture of her daughter, whom she fondly expects to meet on the right hand of the Eternal throne. Oh that she may search the scriptures, that she may be taught to discriminate between the true faith &amp; the poetry of religion. Every one loved the gentle Grand duchess. for she was gentle &amp; kind to every one &amp; the interest in all that relates to her is universal, it pervades all ranks.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-488-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-488">488</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday. Aug 29<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> I did not forget thursday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-489-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-489">489</a></span></span> it was the anniversary on the birth of our angel Charlie and today is that of my darling little Johnie, he completes his first year today &amp; my heart is overflowing with thankfulness to the Giver. I can reflect upon the gentleness &amp; intelligence of the former who was taken almost three years ago from my arms to those of his Saviour, and the sprightliness of this one who has been sent to cheer me for that loss is a delight to the whole house. he does not walk alone quite, but attempts words, “that “dont “taa-taa “Mama &amp;c &amp; some of the garments our more fragile Charlie wore when he was two years old, fit Johnie now.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday Sept 12<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> My dear Whistler came home within three weeks,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-490-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-490">490</a></span></span> he had been detained five days at a wayside village hourly waiting the Count, who travelling in a state carriage met with many obstructions, this was very trying to an Engineer, but mine is not unreasonable &amp; was too happy to find us all well at last &amp; to be restored to us in better health himself than when he left, to fret over lost time. he must soon leave us again to go to Hamburg to meet &amp; bring home our darling Debo. May God bless the undertaking! We have received several reports<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-491-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-491">491</a></span></span> of her enjoyment in her trip to Scotland, present at the grand ceremony of the dedication of Sir Walter Scotts monument in the Prince’s S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Gardens Edinburgh,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-492-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-492">492</a></span></span> spent a day on Loch Lomond<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-493-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-493">493</a></span></span> with such rapture she only wanted us all around her to make it complete. she was enjoying the society of our friend Kate Prince when she last wrote, anticipating the meeting her father &amp; travelling home after her years absence. My trembling heart faints at the bare idea of the storms she may encounter in crossing the North Sea! for now our bright Summer has given place to Autumn &amp; a strong westerly wind ruffles the Neva &amp; sounds stormy. In God is my trust! what else could comfort in doubt &amp; suspence. such as mine now, for yesterdays<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-494-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-494">494</a></span></span> mail brought us letters from our native land &amp; the reports of my loved Sister Marias health very alarming, she was going to the Springs &amp; how eager I feel for fresh accounts! that dear, gentle, Sister! my heart aches at the possibility of never seeing her more in this world!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-495-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-495">495</a></span></span> Oh it is selfish, sinful in me, to wish to detain her in this world of sorrow, when God says “it is Enough.” &amp; when so many mutually dear to us, wait to bear her to her eternal home where all tears are wiped away &amp; joys which the heart of man cannot dream of are in store for her, thro much tribulation indeed this gentle Sister has long been preparing for Heaven &amp; her example of submission &amp; cheerfulness are proofs of the comfort we all may have if we thus trust in Jesus. God has removed me far from her sick couch, but distance cannot divide my heart from hers! we were wont to have but one mind &amp; I feel the joy of grief in thinking of her! if we are not to meet again in this world, may my chief concern be to prepare to meet her around the Throne of the Redeemer. My Mother sends me the painful intelligence of my cousin A M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span>D having been killed in a duel!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-496-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-496">496</a></span></span> I shudder to think of a soul rushing thus into the presence of its Maker! nothing in my opinion can excuse the accepting a challenge. the <span class="CharOverride-1">truly</span> courageous will brave the worlds frown &amp; be undaunted by it.

I must not omit recording the speedy removal of the poor German<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-503-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-503">503</a></span></span> whom I went with Miss Funk to visit in his miserable shed the memorable sunday of the thunder storm. he died the next friday. that pious lady several times stood at his bedside comforting him with words from the book of life &amp; had the proof that he too had searched it from his taking up &amp; finishing many verses she commenced. she attended his funeral taking the little girls with her to his grave. I spent last Saturday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-504-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-504">504</a></span></span> at the Gellibrand datcha again, but returned home to tea as Whistler &amp; Jemie were not of our party to the country, they went to Alexandrofsky. Col Melnikoff having been their guest at dinner. We enjoyed the fine weather. it was indeed propitious as there was a Russian fête given by Count Cooshiloff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-505-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-505">505</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>to his peasantry &amp; being only a short &amp; very shady walk we all went. the Mansion is beyond the beautiful dairy which belongs to his estate, all this property is improved &amp; we rejoiced to see the peasants (whose labour keeps it in such high cultivation, in their holiday suits filling two long tables on the lawn, which was soon covered with basons of excellent soup. with a portion of brown &amp; also white bread to each, huge fish pies garnished the board, and a band of music stationed near increased their enjoyment. I wish it had been a Temperance feast. but it was just the opposite, first beer was handed in buckets, &amp; at last vodkee without water was passed about in tumblers I observed even pretty, young girls drank freely, to say nought of their mothers &amp; grand Sires. We had gone behind the scenes to peep at the soup making out in the open air in great iron cauldrons it amused us <span class="CharOverride-1">neat housekeepers</span> to watch the rough manners of the mujics who ladled out the portions, having chopped the boiled beef first on the boards, spoon it up with their palms to give each bowl its proportion of solid food. When their stomachs were filled the peasants were sounded to leave the long tables - squads of beggars were waiting to gather up the fragments that remained for they are in attendance at every public fête from the Saints day down - Music sounded at the other front of the Lordly mansion &amp; we followed to see what next, the peasantry had already filled the beautiful lawn at the foot of which is an artificial lake just on the margin of which were erected two very tall poles not only barked, but soaped, to be as slippery as possible at the top of each a suit of new clothes, belt, hat &amp; all even to boots. &amp; many were the competitors in climbing for such a prize. It was really quite exciting, my Willies attention could not be diverted even by the Juggler on the Lawn, or Punch &amp; Judy, or the Cosmorama, how relieved we all were when the two lucky lads at last succeeded in reaching the top of the poles &amp; bore off their prizes, they were soon dressed &amp; went in triumph to the Balcony where the Count &amp; Countess<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-506-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-506">506</a></span></span> were surrounded by gay ladies &amp; officers. the peasant knelt at the Countess feet &amp; kissed her hands. we could not hear the speeches, but saw her bend to kiss his brow. We had pointed out to us the very fair young sister of the countess<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-507-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-507">507</a></span></span> &amp; the tall officer by her side proved to be the young Count Strogonoff, whose kindness to our boys on our voyage across the Baltic has rendered his name interesting to us. he is the betrothed of this heiress. her fathers beautiful seat<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-508-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-508">508</a></span></span> is not five minutes row off from the scene we were up. just across the little lake. Showers of sugur plums, nuts &amp;c kept the children of the peasantry near the balcony. I watched the Count fill the tiny palms of a sweet little girl beside the Countess, from time to time.

A very nice young English lady attended upon it as governess,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-510-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-510">510</a></span></span> &amp; already the little girl speaks English as if she had been taught in Victorias nursery.

And the inteval I shall occupy by recording as briefly as possible the changes which a fortnight has brought about in my family circle. Whistler placed our dear James &amp; Willie as boarders at Mons Jourdons school<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-514-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-514">514</a></span></span> monday before last, &amp; the next day<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-515-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-515">515</a></span></span> he himself seemed sorry to leave me with only Johnie to amuse me in my loneliness, tho of course he felt it a privilige as well as duty to go to meet our dear Debo at Hamburg. he will not know what a contest there was in my heart as I saw the Steamer bearing him away while I held baby closer than ever to me as we stood on our three-story-high balcony to gaze after dear father, yet if I wept, I also rejoiced that he was to have a three weeks reprieve from rail road duties<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-516-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-516">516</a></span></span> &amp; a trip to Berlin on his way back with his only daughter - his day of leaving S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg exactly fulfilling her years absence from us.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-517-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-517">517</a></span></span> Our Consul M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gibson was most glad to have my husbands society on his route to England, we have in possession several nice peices of furniture which were favorites of his- especially his french clock. for his health does not admit of his return to this post where he has been so highly respected twenty years. we shall miss him much, who will now forward my letters to England by the Courier? who will enable us to receive our Gallignani without the Censors clipping out all the highest seasoned bits of news? he has never been well enough to return my husbands calls, since the introduction he offered in propria persona to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> &amp; Miss W on their first becoming established in the Bobrinski Dom. but sent me his card with P.P.C.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-518-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-518">518</a></span></span> as he has heretofore upon his leaving S<span class="CharOverride-9">t </span>P for the winter. My dear boys have almost daily exchanged billet doux with Mother since their strange absence of a week at a time from home. James reported every thing “first rate” even to brown bread &amp; salt for breakfast &amp; quass for dinner.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-519-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-519">519</a></span></span> and Willie forebore to complain of home sickness, tho our friend M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Prince reported when he went one evening to see them that poor Will looked very doleful.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-520-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-520">520</a></span></span> Our coachman thought me no doubt very hard hearted when he drove me out for an airing one day the first week the boys were at school &amp; stopped before Mons Jourdons that I would not get out. James! Willie! he exclaimed thinking I could not be aware where he had chosen to take me — I ordered him to the Summer gardens which face the school,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-521-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-521">521</a></span></span> being upon the opposite side of the Champ de Mars where all the grand reviews are held by the Emperor. there I took a solitary promenade, wishing I might be met by the pupils of Mons. Jourdon, for their daily walk in the season for it is to the Summer garden. Never shall I forget the delight mutually experienced as I welcomed my dear boys home the <span class="CharOverride-1">first</span> Saturday!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-522-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-522">522</a></span></span> Mother. Mother I heard them call as soon as the front door was opened &amp; they were in such a glow, the looked <span class="CharOverride-1">almost</span> handsome in their new round black cloth caps set to one side their cropped heads &amp; the light school uniform of grey trowsers, black jacket<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-523-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-523">523</a></span></span> &amp; velvet stock made them appear taller &amp; certainly straighter. Willie was in such an excitement he went down to the court after dinner to ride about it on H. Eastwicks<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-524-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-524">524</a></span></span> new pony. James found the new suit too tight for his drawing lesson. he sacrificed vanity to comfort &amp; was not diverted from his two hours drawing by the other boys frolic which argued well for Jemies determination to improve as he promised father would<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-525-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-525">525</a></span></span> in his absence. My dear boys told me much of their masters &amp; class mates as they enjoyed their curd &amp; cream &amp; good bread &amp; butter at tea time. then asked for a warm shower bath as a Sat nights indulgence, after which Willie shared my room or rather I &amp; baby had taken possession of the boys former quarters, so Jemie slept in what we call “Aunt Alicias room” that our diminished circle might thus be drawn closer together, we had abandoned the front of the house that double windows might be put in. What a privilige I felt it to have my dear boys at family prayers on the Sabbath morning. I observed with pleasure too how well they behaved at church. Henry Harrison<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-526-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-526">526</a></span></span> came home with us to dinner &amp; Mons. Lamartine also joined us then that he might see his former pupils In the afternoon I had the three boys assembled in my room, read &amp; talked with them upon the duty to God &amp; to their teachers &amp; associates. I could not but remark darling Willies clinging to me, his attention to all I wished, but I did not understand the deeper tenderness which was swelling his heart as the hour for leaving home drew nigh. We spent the twilight hour in the recital of what he had suffered all <span class="CharOverride-1">the week</span> from home-sickness. I could but weep with my tender hearted Willie the first half hour, as I thus sympathised he told me all, &amp; it was a sacred &amp; sweet privilige to comfort him. When I at last put the question “Will you let the boys go tonight without you?” he answered still sobbing. “Oh no! it is <span class="CharOverride-1">right</span> to go to school. father wishes it &amp; I will try all I can to study to please him!” May our Almighty Father strengthen this purpose of his youthful mind! &amp; may time accustom. him to his privations in being from home. I cannot wish him ever to become indifferent to absence from it When I talked to my more manly James about his brothers claims upon him for sympathy while away from my side, I unfortunately added “you do not know what he feels” then Jemies wounded love melted him into tears as he uttered “Oh Mother you think I don’t miss being away from home!” he brushed away the shower with the back of his hand as quickly as if fearing to be caught weeping. Dear boys! may they never miss me as I do them. After tea Willies grief was renewed as the moment of parting came. Mary went down with him to the Droshky &amp; heard him say in reply to Henry Harrisons “dont cry Willie! look at me I dont mind going back to school! “Ah Henry you are not leaving your Mother!” When I had proposed to Willie that I should call some day to see them at Mons Jourdons, he had the self denial to recommend that I should not until he should be better reconciled to his new situation, he feared it would make him more home-sick “if I only look out of the windows &amp; fancy you may, some of you be in the Summer gardens I cant stand it!”</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">October 6<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> Tuesday night. The house has almost the stillness of the grave &amp; I may while on the watch as sick nurse write of that which has engrossed all my time &amp; thoughts these ten days past. What a shock it will occasion to Whistler &amp; Debo when they arrive to hear all I have gone thro, &amp; they will see how near we have been losing our precious little Johnie. the crisis is just past &amp; tho daily there are hours when his unfavorable symptoms prevail, yet we may hope now God will spare us the affliction of having to bury the little one who has the year past caused joy to return to our home circle. Poor Marys heart has been almost broken at the prospect of losing him. Never have I witnessed sufferings so extreme, so protracted in an infants frame. I could only pray that these might be softened. I dared not pray to have his life on earth prolonged if our Infinitely wise &amp; compassionate Saviour designed to take him early to his home in Heaven. I may say “tears have been my meat day &amp; night”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-527-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-527">527</a></span></span> yet hymns have been my solace as I paced the chamber hour after hour striving to win sleep to my darlings eye lids. Doct Rogers has visited him four times a day &amp; some nights has staid till after twelve in hopes of his prescriptions giving ease to the little sufferer, yet he has for his own satisfaction called in a consulting physician who yet meets him here daily. A German doct who for twenty years has been presiding physician at the childrens hospital.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-528-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-528">528</a></span></span> he explains away the mysteriousness of my baby’s attack of Dysentery, by telling us it is an epidemic in some of the neighbouring towns &amp; has told its victims ten a day even in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg lately. he called it very properly a visitation sent from God. no doubt in mercy sent to check dependence on creature comforts. Our cup would have been too full without this check, for we are looking for the arrival of my dear husband with darling Debo tomorrow. My excited mind keeps my body from sinking under fatigue. for now tho every one is asleep in the house &amp; neighbourhood I feel like sitting up all night, indeed mid night is past, how beautiful the moonlight is! my husband &amp; daughter are I trust gazing in admiration upon its mild beams at Cronstadt<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-529-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-529">529</a></span></span> &amp; lifting their souls to the Creator</p>

May God of his infinite mercy grant that the solemn impressions of this death be enduring! we had family worship in this back chamber before the boys said good night, dear children! I fear at school they hurry thro their prayers in the multitude of different creeds. I felt so ill this morning. when I first awoke aching in every part of my frame. yet went to the parlor to lead the family devotions &amp; made breakfast for the rest tho I could taste nothing. My kind physician has been both yesterday &amp; today to visit me. Our pastor also has called today to pour the balm of consolation &amp; to offer sympathy. dear old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon has sent to ask after the health of our baby! I have sent to say my first visit after that to the house of God, shall be to her, it will be a motive for my going out, &amp; doct R urges me so much to take the air, for I suppose fatigue &amp; sorrow tells upon my countenance. Once today only have I stolen into that chamber where all that remains to us of Johnie lies, shall I ever forget the expression of that sweet face? tho so changed from what it was in healthful beauty, it is beautiful still. the deep sunken eyes cast a sad expression thro their long dark lashes, but the mouth smiles still, his dark brown curls are not long enough to shade the noble forehead which is so like Kirkies! and his snow white hands as perfectly beautiful as was that angel brothers in life &amp; in death! —— I resume my task facinating tho so heart rending while I am alone an hour after tea.

We thought he recognised his dear father, and perhaps he did not look upon Sister as a stranger for he had heard her name so constantly, so that she could have the privilige of aiding us in carrying him about, for his sufferings rendered it necessary we should night &amp; day pace the chamber with him in our arms. and thankful am I that mine never wearied “As thy need so shall thy strength be”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-538-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-538">538</a></span></span> I have fully experienced in such seasons of affliction. Our hopes were uppermost the first day or two after Whistler &amp; Debos return and we were permitted to rejoice that they had come home. but then succeeded stronger fears our good doct Rogers &amp; doct F<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-539-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-539">539</a></span></span> who still attended as consulting physician apprehended that the head would be attacked from our precious little sufferer lifting his arms so much. Oh how my heart sunk when the ointment for blistering<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-540-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-540">540</a></span></span> the back of the neck was ordered &amp; I had to apply it! that sore spot never healed, after death, blood flowed from it. The thirst which the doct had so often questioned me about as a sure attendant upon the disease, at last came. Forgive me Oh my Saviour that thy thirst upon the Cross should never before have impressed my soul! Oh my God I have indeed needed thy correction! And this little one whom thou hast now taken, after have purified him thro suffering – has seemed to me as a victim for my sins. Oh God humble me! Holy Spirit keep these impressions in lively exercise, that I may ever be looking to Eternity: tho our babys restlessness in a measure abated towards the last, I could hear his teeth grind in the agonies of death! Ah why was it so hard for the “little one” of whom, Jesus said “such is the kingdom of heaven”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-541-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-541">541</a></span></span> – these struggles with our last enemy? if not to teach us the beginning of wisdom the fear of God.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-542-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-542">542</a></span></span> while we adore Him may we fear to offend Him for our God is a consuming fire.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-543-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-543">543</a></span></span> but if we strive to resist sin, which is the sting of death to us under the law, death will have no terrors to the believer, in Christ, who has overcome the grave.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-544-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-544">544</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thursday evening 29<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> Oct.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-545-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-545">545</a></span></span> My dear husband charged me (as he left me to go with Debo to listen to the trial of a new organ at a German church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-546-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-546">546</a></span></span> for a few hours before tea - if I should have painful sensations on being left alone to call our good Mary to the drawing room. I am not well, nor can it be expected I should, but it is rather an indulgence sometimes to be solitary when the full heart needs relief &amp; if tears fall over my records they will not be checked as if those so dear to me were present. Ah what a luxury to weep over the memory of my little Johnie! I seldom encourage this selfish grief, fearing it is sinful in Gods sight, for has He not evinced love in calling that precious child from a world of sin &amp; sorrow ere he could discern good &amp; evil: And now I will go on from my last record. I would not leave out of this account the funeral services of my darling baby. as he died in the room where he was born, so, almost the same circle of friends assembled to join in these most solemn &amp; touching obsequies, who had witnessed the dear little ones baptism in the same parlor fourteen months previously. Our pastor &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Law had seen me in another room while they were collecting, &amp; while some who delighted in our beautiful Johnie were gazing fondly upon all that remained to us of him. My dear Whistler, George Prince &amp; Mary had placed the dear body in the neat box which had been made by our sympathising countrymen at Alexandrofsky. poor Mary had lifted her darling from the pillow for the last time! And when told all had left the room I went to take my last lingering gaze! what a reluctance I felt to parting from the body I had so much delighted in! as I kissed the beautiful hands, they were as pliable as ever in life, so soft &amp; dimpled! but ah the icy coldness struck to my heart. Whistler brought in our boys &amp; dear Debo came to look for the last time at Johnie.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">When I entered the circle an hour after in our drawing room where I knew the crib had been placed at the end of the large apartment just where I had offered my baby at the font, it was with difficulty Imaintained composure, I dared not lift my eyes. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ellerby &amp; his dear good wife who had taken so much interest in my baby while in health &amp; sickness I knew were present. The sympathising Merrieellees family too.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-547-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-547">547</a></span></span> our kind Doct all our countrymen from Alexandrofsky of course our kind neighbour M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes &amp; George Prince, and several others dear Miss Funk had from first to last proved her belief that it is better to go to the house of mourning than the house of feasting!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-548-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-548">548</a></span></span> When I could think that all present truly sympathized it was a melancholy gratification Our beautiful burial service how impressive! how comforting! Immediately upon its conclusion my kind husband upon whose arm I had leaned, supported me to my back chamber where Johnie was born &amp; from whence his happy spirit had taken flight. Whistler had the privilige of seeing the little body again, but I was spared knowing exactly when it was enclosed until the loud grief of poor Mary called me to her side to comfort &amp; soothe her, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes had cut the curls &amp; sent them for her to give me, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Eastwick &amp; George Prince went in the carriage of the former to bear the box to the vault of the English church, true mourners with us in our loss for they loved the little one, and it has been comforting to us that we needed no hirelings even to remove him from this home to that depository. We have obtained permission since, thro our Ambassador’s interest with the authorities of the Police that when an expected ship comes to Cronstadt which is to be sent to our native land this autumn, we may have the precious box transported thither. Which of us shall go next to another world is the most solemn reflection. May God sanctify every affliction to us &amp; Oh may this last stroke loosen our hold upon earth &amp; each succeeding help to prepare us for heavenly joys. And oh the blissful welcome from these happy spirits who have only gone a short space before us to where we all hope to be! How much I have thought of christian friends <span class="CharOverride-1">there</span> who would so differently view <span class="CharOverride-1">my loss</span>. such saints as Miss Hirst &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Nichols, how blind &amp; idolatrous that mother who could desire to detain a little one from the Lord of all! tho I weep let me faint not,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-549-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-549">549</a></span></span> but press on daily towards the attainment of a blessed reunion of all I have loved whom God has taken before me to an eternal home. The day after our funeral service at home, we all attended Church morning &amp; afternoon.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-550-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-550">550</a></span></span> dear Debo &amp; I attended the Lords table together. When shall I have the happiness of seeing my husband kneeling at the Altar to commemorate the death of Jesus who has so loving invited <span class="CharOverride-1">all</span> who believe in Him (as I know my dear husband does with a deep veneration &amp; love) thus to shew forth the Lords death till He come! for some wise purpose my prayers are not yet answered, I must wait my Gods appointed time &amp; yet pray unceasingly Our darling boys had to go back to school at bed time, but we improved the evening in reading aloud &amp; had family prayers ere nine oclock came. Willie &amp; I parted as usual in tears, dear Jemie may love his home as well, but he is blessed with an elasticity of spirits which rise above the thoughts which cause his younger, gentler brother to cling to his poor mother, Willie would like school if he could return to us every night, last Saturday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-551-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-551">551</a></span></span> when they were enjoying being seated in our drawing room after, he picked up a book which he recollected I had read aloud while he &amp; Jemie drew last winter &amp; said “Oh Mother those were first rate evenings! I wish they could be, over=again” Willie has kindly offered to walk with Mary to church, knowing how much she misses Johnie, he thus tries the only day he can, to be attentive to her. bless my thoughtful kind little Willie for it!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-552-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-552">552</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday November 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span> No ice yet, indeed today the thermometer is at 1 deg of heat. I had a short walk with my husband after breakfast, we looked for the English book-store in vain. &amp; regret Kirton has moved from the Galernia<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-553-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-553">553</a></span></span> it was such a convenient distance for us to go.

The Harrisons not yet arrived here tho it is more than three weeks since he wrote from Ireland.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-555-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-555">555</a></span></span> little Alicia is therefore still under my care, I grow fond of the little one who occupies my lost ones crib. What hard struggles I endure to subdue my selfish grief! Yesterday I was struck by my bereaved friend M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Nichols extract in the last letter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-556-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-556">556</a></span></span> received from him “Let power be given - To draw - not them to Earth, but us to Heaven.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-557-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-557">557</a></span></span> &amp; shall endeavour to keep this warning in view, that when memory bids painful images of my darlings sufferings pass in review, I may lift my heart in prayer to Jesus to help to keep my thoughts upon the realities of an unseen world. Why should the thrilling tones of my babys voice as I last heard them expressing the sufferings of that agonizing thirst still cause me to weep bitterly! <span class="CharOverride-1">it is past</span> &amp; he has forgotten it for the gentle Shepherd leads him to pure streams of living waters.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-558-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-558">558</a></span></span> why am I ever seeking to recal my babys countenance in the sleep of death! the bright expression of his happy face as it was in health never forsakes his fond mothers mental gaze, and it is in a state of glorified beauty &amp; happiness! Why do I press my lips &amp; weep as in a stolen indulgence at sight of his little down=pillow which scented as it is from all the alleviatives used while his darling head rested on it those eighteen nights &amp; days is more odoriferous to me than the most costly perfumes. Jesus look down in mercy upon me &amp; put strength in me! lay not this grief as sin to my charge Oh thou compassionate &amp; Holy One! but grant that when Thou has tried me &amp; purified my soul thro suffering Thou mayest take me to where my little one has gone. My husband last week invited a fellow passenger of his &amp; Debos from Stettin who is passing a few weeks here - to dine with us en famille. Our good Doct Rogers only was invited to meet M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Bainbridge.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-559-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-559">559</a></span></span> I was pleased with the stranger who is middle aged &amp; rather in feeble health from having lived many years in India. this also renders his conversation interesting, I listened to his remarks about India with pleased attention as we sat round the bright fire after dinner, he could scarcely account for his feeling so much more comfortable in our drawing room than in any other in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg until its being carpetted all over &amp; curtained according to the English mode was forced upon his conviction, for grates are used in most houses occupied by his countrymen here. he fell quite in love with my warm foot-stool &amp; said he should look out for one like it on his return to London. he suffers from cold feet &amp; has a horror of draughts as is the case with most persons who have lived years in India. he is a perfect gentleman so mild, so moderate in his choice of language where dissapproval must be expressed, one just fitted to make friends wherever he roams &amp; he seems bent on visiting many nations. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Bainbridge on finding Debos taste for music invited her to go in his carriage to hear the rehearsal of the court singings last friday morning.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-560-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-560">560</a></span></span> she referred him to me, &amp; as I could make no excuse for not wishing to be one of the party, I was more than repaid for the effort to gratify my dear daughter, &amp; agreed with her I never had heard such perfect music in my life. Oh that she would be content to substitute these rehearsals of sacred sounds for the Opera! While I shut out even the sedate looking Choristers with my handkerchief to my eyes, I could almost imagine myself near the throne of God. Oh how delicious were the tears I shed as I thought of <span class="CharOverride-1">my</span> little one who had loved music so fondly here! with his golden harp – for now he is an angel! As we were singing that verse of the morning hymn the second sunday I attended our church after I lost him<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-561-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-561">561</a></span></span> the same thought brought me joy in my grief tho it overpowered me &amp; caused me to lose my voice, that he was among those who never weary in singing praise around the throne of God! How impatient I feel to be among that happy number! And my loving Saviour will not exile any who wish to go there. longer than necessary to fit them for the change. Holy Spirit quicken me to repentence &amp; make me entirely submissive, believing, hoping, waiting, in Jesus to whom be all the praise. And enable me in my life to exhibit my dependence in Thee Alone.</p>

This is an era in the worlds history when wars &amp; rumours of wars verify our Saviours testimony that these must be the latter days, for our journals are filled with news of distress of nations from famine, pestilence &amp; storms. I was almost tempted to copy the details of the providential preservation of life in the thrilling report of the Steamer G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Westerns<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-569-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-569">569</a></span></span> last voyage to the city of New York from Liverpool, because it seemed so solemn a warning of human helplessness &amp; such a subject of praise for Gods forbearance &amp; mercy should be handed down to future generations. Our friends the Crufts whose acquaintance we first made here last Summer, were on their return home after two years spent in Europe for health - among the 260 souls on board, &amp; probably they were of the 60 who partook of the holy communion - it would be for the first time, but I trust not the last! Our hearts are hard by nature yet Oh it would seem such an especial evidence of the Divine goodness &amp; love must make an enduring impression upon all who sought the Saviour on the mighty deep - for when they were ready to perish He commanded the raging waves &amp; the storm was subdued. the Capt confessed “the hand of God was in it!” Ah in that very storm, how many bodies must have found a watery grave! how many souls have been called unprepared into the presence of their judge! while these favored ones have had years added to their term to give them opportunities to shew that they believe in the efficacy of prayers. From the Sat till the Tues. while the storm raged the account reports several religious exercises the last was one of thanksgiving &amp; praise to God for His interposition when a watery grave seemed inevitable, and before the favored ship entered the habor of N York the passengers not only presented a liberal sum to the Capt. officers &amp; crew but instituted a fund for the aid of destitute families deprived of their support by loss of husbands, fathers, or sons at sea. to be called “The G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Western fund,” in commemoration of their own preservation. The G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Western brought our last dates from New York to Liverpool. But no letters from my dear family addressed to myself, tho I am thankful to learn thro one to Debo that my precious Sister Maria’s health was benefitted by her sojourn at the mineral springs. This morning my dear daughter has gone to M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Gellibrands to take her german lesson with Elizabeth Ropes who is not well enough to come to our Study as usual. &amp; as it is not yet time to prepare to welcome James &amp; Willie from School I scribble up my family record as I would fain do each saturday. I must look back to the 3<span class="CharOverride-9U">rd</span> of this month,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-570-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-570">570</a></span></span> the anniversary of my wedding day being the most blessed of all anniversaries to me, as each year I sensibly feel a higher appreciation of the blessing God bestowed upon me in my beloved husband, but as I like not compliments on such occasions I reminded none of the family until the day was over, tho I had thought much of the changes which mark the period &amp; had in the solitude of my own room poured out my thanks mingled with tears to the Searcher of hearts for His having crowned my lot with mercies. for even afflictions are such if viewed by the eye of Faith. My dear husband &amp; I talked until the clock struck one, of the first period of our married life when Debo was the little one, and we acknowledged to each other that yet as the <span class="CharOverride-1">only</span> <span class="CharOverride-1">daughter</span> this dear gentle one continues the object of our deepest solicitude &amp; tenderest care. As we are wont to kneel side by side in our chamber our silent prayers mingle for spiritual gifts for the four darling children yet spared us on earth, &amp; it is our delight to talk at times to each other of the four whom God took early to their home in heaven where we hope all will meet at last, to part no more. Let me not omit to record my gratitude to God who has disposed my husband to seek counsel from on high, that he now never travels without his bible as his companion, and now that I must kneel without him at the footstool of mercy my solace is to commit him in prayer to One who follows him on all his journeys. The Harrisons arrived the wednesday of last week<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-571-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-571">571</a></span></span> having journeyed almost all the route from London by land. no letters had met them from this after they set out &amp; landing from the Stettin Steamer no friend was waiting to tell them of our loss. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Harrisons first question was for her infant, her next for mine! The Victory a London Steamer had met them near Cronstadt, but they had no suspicion that the remains of our little Johnie were on board, that the precious body may be sent forward from London to our hallowed enclosure in the Stonington village burial place. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Harrison has many times since said to me “suppose it had been my Alice instead of your Johnie!” Gods holy will be done! <span class="CharOverride-1">I needed the</span> chastisement &amp; my innocent little one was taken to a heavenly home.

But I record it to my Saviours glory that unworthy as I am, He has enabled me to feel it to be good to enter the cloud of affliction where His glorious presence becomes visible to the mourner who cannot bear the false glitter of this worlds joys, but whose soul then stretches its gaze to the realities of Eternity. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Harrisons little Alicia more than repaid me for my attention to her by her fondness of me. when her father asked where was Mama she pointed to me &amp; said “there,” indeed to let her own Mamas facinations have full effect, I had to screen myself, for the whole family spent the day of their arrival with us. they took Henry from school &amp; when their carriage was announced before tea Alicia &amp; all bade us adieu, a happy- unbroken family band went home together!

I could not have been in the festive throng after the holy rite &amp; it might have appeared rude to leave without partaking the hospitalities which our clergyman always remains to partake of.

			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday Dec 5<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> My own dear husband was welcomed home by Debo &amp; I last tuesday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-581-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-581">581</a></span></span> to dinner. he had complained of nothing in the months absence thro his several letters<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-582-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-582">582</a></span></span> to us, but <span class="CharOverride-1">home</span> sickness, his patience was tested to its utmost endurance, while waiting the movements of the great man, to whom all ranks in the Engineer department, but Whistler, bow in humiliating submission &amp; in presence of whom they tremble, as man only ought to do to God! however the Count has always been polite towards my husband,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-583-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-583">583</a></span></span> &amp; now this vexatious inspection of his work is over for this season, he can annoy us no further. A short peice of the rail road 22 versts had been completed,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-584-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-584">584</a></span></span> in the prospect of the Count coming over it from Colpener,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-585-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-585">585</a></span></span> locomotives &amp; trains were sent to meet them, refreshments had been prepared &amp; taken in the cars by Winans &amp; Harrison, but Whistler only was to profit by these attentions, the Countess<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-586-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-586">586</a></span></span> having met her lord monday evening at Tchoodver, they travelled together to the palace in this city, on the chaussé, Col Melnikoff was honored by their taking possession of his house for the night! but of course he was not invited to act the host, he sought the hospitality of another officer for himself, where also Whistler was entertained, my husband always testifies as to the courtesies of the Russian officers, their eagerness to welcome travellers is the more praise worthy, when their circumscribed means are contrasted with their graceful hospitality, many of them have not more than <span class="CharOverride-9">$</span>200 salary. they are all educated as gentlemen.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-587-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-587">587</a></span></span> While my husband was absent our dear boys had no praznicks<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-588-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-588">588</a></span></span> altho he wrote us two had been observed in the interior<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-589-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-589">589</a></span></span> &amp; he had felt glad to fancy them enjoying themselves at home, last saturday indeed Jemie had been kept in school until night, to write a given portion of french over 25 times as a punishment<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-590-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-590">590</a></span></span> for having loitered to chat with a class-mate after their recitation was finished instead of marching back to his seat according to order. poor fellow! it was rather severe when he had looked only for rewards at the end of the week. during which he had not had one mark of disapprobation. he was too much elated by his number of good balls for perfect recitations, &amp; forgot the <span class="CharOverride-1">disobedience</span> of orders is a capital offense under military discipline. He lost his drawing lesson. &amp; made us all unhappy at home thro his detention at school. Willie would have waited for him but that he would not permit, poor coacher &amp; ponies must have suffered most after all, for the weather was exceeding cold, snowing &amp; freezing, yet there they waited from 2 oclock until 5 1/2. We had tried to keep a nice dinner warm for poor Jemie, but his appetite had forsaken him altho his breakfast had been at seven &amp; only a penny roll since. Koritzkie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-591-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-591">591</a></span></span> had been precisely at four to give him his Saturdays treat a drawing lesson &amp; Jemie dashed the tears in vexation from his eyes, I hope he will not forget the lesson upon obedience! his cheerfulness however was soon restored by his gentle Sisters kindness &amp; we had our usual Sat nights reading, before the bath. When the boys left us to go to sleep at Mons Jourdons on sunday night<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-592-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-592">592</a></span></span> as usual, they were cheered by the prospect of the two praznicks<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-593-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-593">593</a></span></span> they have had this week. &amp; were not long after their dear fathers welcome home in coming for theirs. I must not omit to record that the river was closed last Saturday night,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-594-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-594">594</a></span></span> the season has been remarkably open &amp; mild, usually the Neva has been travelled over by sledges a fortnight before this - and besides the ice not coming down in due season, a long stretch of a verst &amp; half below the works of the new bridge was left quite free for ferry boats to ply across several days.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-595-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-595">595</a></span></span> however the cold has been so intense this week it is already frozen across. appearing like an immense mirror, while the rough masses of ice from Ladoga are piled up in striking contrast, but so soon as the police give freedom to sledges to cross to the islands roads will be levelled.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-596-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-596">596</a></span></span> Our boys took their skates when they went to Alexandrofsky on wednesday, it was very lucky that their praznic gave them freedom for Harrison Eastwicks birth day,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-597-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-597">597</a></span></span> he came to town to breakfast with them, &amp; the happy trio of cronies did not loiter after it, they stopped at the Gostinandvor to provide themselves each, a pr of fur mittens &amp; fur boots our boys were restored to us at bed time by M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Eastwick himself. he took the moonlight drive to town with them &amp; to put an end to my thanks said he enjoyed it. We had to put off their recounting all the pleasure of their visit until breakfast, for a warm bath was ready in their own room &amp; good Mary had a bright fire in their grate to tempt them to it. Jemie had been so much interested in the exhibition of the Magic lantern<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-598-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-598">598</a></span></span> (which M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Eastwick has lately imported from England to add to the domestic resources of his boys) displaying the planetary system &amp; simplyfying the science of astronomy to their comprehension, he found his evenings entertainment as charming as his days freedom to range out of doors had been. they left their skates &amp; sledge at Alexandrofsky in the hope of other holidays, &amp; because the English ice hill club are not to offer the winters amusement to which we have always subscribed, they are the better pleased that at the American works ice hills are to be formed this season. On thursday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-599-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-599">599</a></span></span> we had our favorite Miss MacMaster &amp; her three interesting pupils Helen Kate &amp; Willie Wood to meet our boys. Henry Harrison also came to dinner &amp; was here till nine when the party broke up, for the Woods were sent for &amp; our sledge was in waiting to take our boys back to Mons Jourdons. Even our Willie went off smiling (instead of weeping as is too often his wont upon a summons to leave home) for a day &amp; half would so soon pass! I was rather startled to hear Henry alluding to an alarm which his parents still suffer from, in poor little Annies state of health, as I had carefully avoided mentioning the subject to our boys, in the dread it might thro childish garrulity reach dear little Annies ears, she being entirely unconcious of having had an Epiliptic fit, the first fortnight after her return home from England. it was very early in the morning when it seized her, as she was amusing her baby sister<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-600-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-600">600</a></span></span> in her own little room, the two children being surrounded by toys, when she suddenly cried out “Oh my head” fell back in convulsions, which lasted two hours, after a long deep slumber succeeding, she awoke &amp; only expressed surprise at finding herself in her mamas bed instead of her own. The nervous fever she had in England, may have predisposed the dear little girl for this, but the dread is a recurrence,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-601-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-601">601</a></span></span> however as her general health has been much better since the fit may it be hoped God will avert such a trial to her parents as to witness her subject to such a dire attendant upon life! </p>

Last Saturday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-603-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-603">603</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Eastwick brought their nurse &amp; baby in hopes of meeting our good doct here wishing to consult him about their little Russian Willie. &amp; as the last day of the week is that I set aside for summing up the other six days, I am almost discouraged in the attempt to keep a diary. Debo went at 7 oclock this evening to the Parsonage to witness the marriage ceremony of her favorite Miss Henley to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Wishaw,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-604-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-604">604</a></span></span> having had the promise of a window upstairs from which she could look down upon the altar. Now that my boys have finished their Sat evening English reading to their dear father &amp; I, we having enjoyed tea which our good Doct partook of with us, they have gone to their room to bathe &amp; I am all alone in our large parlor, for father has gone to escort Sister home.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Friday Christmas day our style Dec 25<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> I shall have a most delightful accompaniment to my notes, while Debo, her father &amp; one of our pastors daughters are playing piano, harp &amp; flute. Yesterday Whistler obtained the favor for our dear boys spending <span class="CharOverride-1">our holiday</span> at home, tho the schools give none, he took them to the Gostinandvor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-605-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-605">605</a></span></span> directly after breakfast to supply them each with a pr of skates, the “English skating ground” being now ready, the weather so mild &amp; they needing exercise so much, I advised them to call for a young Scotsman named Saunders<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-606-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-606">606</a></span></span> who is fond of the amusement &amp; who is a favorite among us, his modest &amp; gentlemanly deportment being very captivating &amp; his having been trained to a proper way of thinking by a pious mother, who is alas separated from a dissolute husband. We are always glad to see young Saunders, he came with his uncle M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Miller &amp; spent an evening by our fire side this week, Whistler delighted him by his imitation of the scotch bag-pipes upon the flute, for we old folks were required to exert our powers of entertainment, as Debo was spending the evening at the Henleys.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-607-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-607">607</a></span></span> Last evening by way of realizing Christmas Eve, we had a small party of young folks to meet our young people,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-608-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-608">608</a></span></span> previous to their assembling, Whistler &amp; I went to Kirtons English book shop<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-609-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-609">609</a></span></span> &amp; selected a Christmas gift for Debo &amp; the boys which I presented this morning directly after breakfast, Jemie seems quite sensible of fathers generosity &amp; has whispered me to dissuade him from the purchase of gifts for the Russian Christmas, how happy it makes me that our plan for then, will not dissappoint our children! Oh that the Saviour who came to Earth (as on this day) &amp; announced by the holy Angels “Peace on Earth, good will to men”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-610-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-610">610</a></span></span> may answer my petitions for the four dear children He has yet left us, to cheer us on our pilgrimage thro this vale of tears! Oh that He may “call them early”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-611-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-611">611</a></span></span> by his Holy Spirit, that they may honor Him in their life among men, &amp; give them tastes &amp; desires for the society of Saints &amp; Angels where we are comforted in believing the <span class="CharOverride-1">four</span> who have gone before us to an unseen world, have already entered upon unending happiness. Our late letters from dear George<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-612-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-612">612</a></span></span> have been rather depressing, how often we think of him so separated from the family circle, which with his domestic tastes must indeed be such a privation, but in this world of trial, we must become resigned to the arrangements of an Invisible over-ruling power, which appoints for each of us situations most favorable for the great reformation man requires to fit him for a heavenly society. What could enable me <span class="CharOverride-1">contentedly</span> to spend years away from my native land, my mother, Sisters brothers &amp; friends, even deprived of the visits of a pastor, but that I cannot doubt God will more than compensate me, by drawing me to the Saviour, who has said “whosoever loveth Mother or child better than me is not worthy of Me”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-613-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-613">613</a></span></span> — I had kind notes from two among my small circle of friends in this city<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-614-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-614">614</a></span></span> today. &amp; my heart was touched with gratitude that comparitive strangers should give a passing interest to a mourner. I gave, with my answer to one on the Island, “Na Chi” to the messenger, the poor serf was as thankful for the grevenic<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-615-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-615">615</a></span></span> as a Yankee would have been for a dollar. </p>

			<p class="Body-Text">Tuesday evening [December] 29<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> Our dear Debo has gone to dine with the Gellibrands &amp; as her father is inclined to read American news papers I shall scribble a while before tea. Last evening while he was gone to Alexandrofsky a solitary letter reached our Russian home by the G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Western from New York, we were too eager to wait his breaking the seal of Maxwell communication,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-626-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-626">626</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>&amp; Debo read it aloud to me while I made tea, it was eight pages, but as his letters always are so entertaining, we were sorry to come to its end. it was well we lingered over tea thus, for Debos favorite Miss Grant<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-627-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-627">627</a></span></span> just at that moment arrived &amp; soon after, my gude mon himself. the young lady seemed exceedingly amused at our having dared to make so free with the Majors property, as it was an unheard of liberty among the English for any women-kind to break the seals of the masters letters, however Whistler only looked pleased that we had taken the first reading &amp; enjoyed the second to himself after tea, when the young ladies scampered off to the piano. I brought my desk to write at the same table beside my husband. Miss G afterwards - when we had towards eleven oclock drawn in a circle around the bright fire - remarked how charmingly we each had pursued our occupation, which a very large parlor gave us the advantage of doing without interfering with each other. she is one of those with whom we need not be ceremonious, for she comes expressly to be with Debo, &amp; tho she says it is the greatest treat she has, to sit &amp; listen to her playing Harp or Piano, yet her own merry voice is often ringing cheerfully in speech or laughter, &amp; we thank her for exciting responding notes from our darling daughter, who much needs more suitable companions to her age than her old mother, or even usually cheerful father. we miss our dear boys so much from home. the house must be too quiet for her, for she seems at times solitary &amp; melancholy, while I in my efforts to appear free from sadness for her sake, in general am really so. I must not omit to record the enjoyment we all had in the three days visit<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-628-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-628">628</a></span></span> of our boys last week, &amp; while they were eager for amusement out of doors, skating &amp;c, they behaved with so much gentleness &amp; consideration in the family circle, especially James, that we have promised if Mons Jourdon does not object, they shall spend New Years evening at M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span>Mirriellees<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-629-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-629">629</a></span></span> where we are all invited sociably.

			<p class="Body-Text">This evening Whistler has been telling me of the loss of another Steamer in Long Island Sound, the new boat on the Norwich route, it was on the same night when the G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Western was detained by the storm off Staten Island on leaving New York this last voyage. that the Atlantic was deprived of all power by an accident to her steam pipe, &amp; the storm continuing to increase in violence she during that night &amp; the next dragged her anchors a distance of 22 miles &amp; at 4 oclock the second day was dashed upon rocks &amp; immediately went to peices. a Steamer &amp; also a small vessel put out in the hope of at least saving the passengers. but the storm was such the were driven back, indeed the gallant commander Capt Dustan hauled down his flag of distress upon seeing them approach knowing their own crew must forfeit their lives for their bravery if the ventured nearer. how aggravating to all on board the ill fated Atlantic! to be so near the land as to be seen by many eager to help them, but not able! yet God in mercy gave them to see that help could only come from His own mighty power! and this those who trusted in Him sought in prayer &amp; we will hope among the forty three bodies drowned in that storm many may be found on the right hand of God at the last day when at the voice of the Saviour the sea even shall give up her dead.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-631-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-631">631</a></span></span> What a warning to those who trust in human intervention, in human forethought &amp; wisdom. Some had boasted of this boat that it could brave any storm the Almighty could send! Ah if by our <span class="CharOverride-1">words</span> we are to be justified, or condemned, should we not stand in awe &amp; thus sin not. The Capt too was so great a favorite many would feel secure from the assurance of his nautical skill, he was a devoted sailor no doubt, for he never left his post thro that awful hurricane, when cold also assailed all on deck, he kept at his post cheering all by his calmness &amp; courage. Alas, alas, for his aged mother, his widow, his helpless little ones who<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-632-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-632">632</a></span></span> dependent on his exertions, may God who disposes men to compassionate such, raise up friends to them, their first intimation of their loss, was the arrival of the dead body at his home on Staten Island.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-633-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-633">633</a></span></span> Oh well may be pray to be delivered from sudden death! but even more earnestly should we pray for grace to live prepared to die. Oh that the living would lay these lessons to heart &amp; redeem the time yet allotted for repentence. My heart has been softened today Wednesday 30<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> by the sympathising letters I have received from my kind Sisters Maria &amp; Kate,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-634-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-634">634</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>and I have indulged in floods of tears which have relieved my full heart. Thanks be to God for all his mercies to me! Every trial has been sweetened by kindness And should I ask more than that all who have left me have gone to Jesus (called early to enter upon joys of Which the imagination of man has no conception. Ah can I compare my griefs with those of the widows, the childless, the orphans made by war or by shipwreck! May God keep me humbled under a sense of my unworthiness, and may the only effect of sorrow upon my heart be to keep it softened by its showers, for holy impressions. When I go into the apartment, where my Johnie first breathed, where his happy spirit was also released &amp; weep over the empty crib, may Jesus look down in pity &amp; forgive a mothers weakness &amp; put strength in me by the blessed promises of the gospel. forbid it that I should indulge in grief rebelliously!

			<p class="Body-Text">January 1847</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday 23<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƨ</span> of our style being 11<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of Russian style. It is three weeks this afternoon since our dear boys came home from school to spend the Russian Christmas &amp; New year holidays, &amp; now it seems not probable they shall return again to Mons Jourdons this winter.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-641-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-641">641</a></span></span> James was drooping from close confinement at school &amp; for two days was confined to his bed with sore throat. I came to him to nurse him at night as by day in our hospital the back chamber &amp; his father took Willie to our room, as his bed fellow, but our dear little Willie also was taken ill the second night &amp; that apartment communicating with the drawing room improper for an invalid he also was brought to share this &amp; for the benefit of the open fire place. Our boys were pronounced sufficently well by Christmas eve Russian Style (being 5<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> of Jan our style) to avail of the invitation they had received from M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Morgan<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-642-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-642">642</a></span></span> to partake of the festivities of the season prepared for her children &amp; their playmates. but the early hours was the strongest argument with us to consent, going at five, and returning at eight or nine, gave them as much frolic as they could derive enjoyment from for it was unalloyed by after suffering. they gradually recovered from their attack &amp; skated with visible benefit almost daily upon the Neva. And Jemie often had crossed on the ice to the Acadamy of Fine arts to spend an hour or two of the early part of the day in the study of his drawing master.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-643-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-643">643</a></span></span> Upon the Russian New Years eve Debo &amp; her father went to pass the evening at the Morgans where “les tableaux vivants”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-644-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-644">644</a></span></span> were the most attractive amusement, tho dancing succeeded before supper, to which last they did not remain but came home to me at 12 1/2. I had been alone, all the evening as our boys had been allowed the indulgence of accompanying the Eastwicks to their home to spend Edwards birth day<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-645-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-645">645</a></span></span> &amp; stay all night. Alas! that dear Jemies eagerness for sports should so often bring illness upon him &amp; cause us so much anxiety. we feared from his pale face &amp; loss of appetite he had taken cold, tho he would not complain as long as he could keep up. Debo had invited the Wilks family to have a musical entertainment &amp; they came the second evening after our dear boys frolic at Alexandrofsky<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-646-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-646">646</a></span></span> &amp; tho they were allowed to sit up until ten I observed James was not in spirits &amp; that he hovered over the fire while every one else felt our drawing room to be so warm we had to open the door of the corridor. I must not forget here to record, how very late Lizzie Ropes was in making her appearance that evening because of the stupidity of the Ishvostic who had driven Miss Scofield<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-647-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-647">647</a></span></span> &amp; herself over to the Island where they had been invited to dine at a Russian merchants,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-648-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-648">648</a></span></span> where M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> G with the Mirriellees family waited an hour longing for the arrival of these damsels. the dinner in the while kept back &amp; in consequence of the delay Elizabeth could not earlier be excused than her coming to us at near ten proved. she was quite excited and seemed almost as ready to cry as to laugh when she recounted to us her terror during the crazy drive of that never to be forgotten hour in the dark with a strange Ishvostic, he proved to be a rude peasant from the interior (herds of them flock each winter to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg with their rough sledges &amp; ponies to make a trifle, which very probably they have to spend in freeing themselves from the recruiting orders which are annually issued to press the poor peasantry to fill up the ranks broken by the desolating war of the Caucases.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-649-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-649">649</a></span></span> Of course these poor fellows are ignorant of the city &amp; especially of its environs tho the will not confess it, &amp; thus when this one was directed to follow the sledge of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gellibrand to a certain house in a certain line on the Island it was expected the young ladies must reach there at the same time as themselves, poor M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> G was extremely alarmed &amp; weeping bitterly among her sympathising friends the other assembled guests. &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> G had said many a time he would give a thousand rubles to have Lizzie brought safe to them! when she &amp; Miss Scofield really came! the latter a stranger to the language &amp; customs had depended entirely upon Elizabeth &amp; it was well she could speak for the Ishvostic had driven them to places she had never been in before &amp; seemed obstinate about enquiring the way, until Lizzie summoned courage to seize his reins &amp; stop his exploring further. I did not understand if the general alarm had destroyed the appetites of the guests. the profusion was as usual at this Russian merchants feasts, &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> J. Ropes seemed to have had a surfeit of rich dishes &amp; champagne. &amp; to be glad to <span class="CharOverride-1">repose</span> while listening to the music at our quiet fire side circle. Lizzie did not stay all night with Debo as she does generally after coming for the evening. her sister could scarcely bear to lose sight of her recovered treasure, so she called for her on her way home from the late dinner party in her own sledge. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning when we assembled at prayers Willie came without James, whom Mary reported to have had a very feverish &amp; disturbed night, his symptoms of a rheumatic attack were soon confirmed, pain in the chest &amp; left side added to our alarm for him, our good doct who always uses mild remedies as possible, ordered oil silk<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-650-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-650">650</a></span></span> to be wrapped around his ankles &amp; feet, indeed wherever the rheumatic pains attacked him, it was like a charm, for altho he could not be touched without screaming for days after, still the aching pains were within half an hour relieved. mustard plaisters repeated upon his chest &amp; side whenever the pains &amp; difficulty in breathing came on, and afterwards the oil silk applied there was as soothing as it had proved to his limbs. the fever &amp; nervous irritability with heavy perspirations when he could sleep were weakening &amp; distressing. Of course my post is always in the sick chamber, this back-room the scene of so many trials to me I occupy as my precious Jemies nurse.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-651-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-651">651</a></span></span> As in the watches of the night season when my babys sufferings caused my eyes neither to slumber or wish sleep I sung hymns which at such seasons are the only welcome sounds to sooth anguish mental &amp; bodily. poor James would ask me for them when he could not win sleep. Oh it is good for us when in health to lay up a store of Gods word in our memories, a verse of scripture becomes an acceptable prayer, when human energies are so prostrated by bodily anguish as not to be roused by the longing to cry unto God in a prayer of our own. He knowing all our weakness has mercifully provided us in the inspired language of His own book with ejaculations of prayer &amp; praise. Even the youthful experience of my darling Jemie has proved that it is a rich treasure, &amp; I trust Gods holy spirit may help him to make a dilligent search &amp; that his mind may be stored with verses suited for every emergency. for the holy scriptures are good for instruction &amp; correction, as they are for support &amp; comfort thro the sufferings of sickness &amp; on the bed of death. it is to this end I require my dear boys in health to commit a verse to memory &amp; to repeat it at breakfast. “What we sow that shall we reap”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-652-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-652">652</a></span></span> let us never weary in striving to walk in the commandments of God. realizing his hand guiding every event towards the great end of our being, even the preparing us to enter into a better &amp; brighter existence, after this life is over, there are moments of gladness even in a sick chamber. All around me in this back room reminds me of my trial of last October. the crib occupied only by the useless basket which was wont to be in use for Johnies change of clothes, the little soft down pillow upon which his beautiful head was supported on my arm till the last! and which is still so powerfully perfumed with the musk which he used to take that it must ever be most nearly associated to the little sick bed - many might wonder at my composure in gazing on these sacred objects, but I can shed delicious tears over them in the hours of the night when none but a compassionate Saviour looks upon me “a woman of a sorrowful spirit”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-653-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-653">653</a></span></span> even the little chairs I touch gently, when I try to bring them into use for Johnies sake! he is only gone home a short time before me! why should I not feel it a sweet privilige to touch what he has so lately handled. even the little pillow I have brought to dear Jemie to support his knees when weariness &amp; weakness has made it difficult to find a position of ease to his rheumatic limbs. Oh my Saviour let not my sojourn in this back room be abused by me that I venture into sinful indulgence of grief, when my soul should rejoice that Thou has secured my “little one” from further suffering, but grant that each visit here in the attendance upon a sick bed of any dear to me, may yeild me opportunities for examing where on my hopes of a hereafter rest, may lead me more to study thy will that it may become my sanctification. I count all things as nought in comparison to the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-654-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-654">654</a></span></span> I have read to Jemie to divert his weariness &amp; pain. he is beginning to recover his appetite. he sleeps better as his fever &amp; thirst are decreasing. We keep 15 deg of heat in his room, &amp; of course I am often enough awake to watch the fire that it never goes out.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday Jan 30<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>Gradually has my darling patient been convalescing all the week, and this morning walked across the floor, what cause for thankfulness, that tho this attack began with such alarming symptoms it has been less protracted than any other preceding of rheumatism. he has been allowed to amuse himself - while seated in M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ơ</span> Maxwells great chair,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-655-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-655">655</a></span></span> with his pencil. and I have read aloud to him, his sisters and his dear fathers visits occasionally during the day have given variety, and he has had appetite to enjoy “manna cassia<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-656-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-656">656</a></span></span> &amp; milk” for breakfast or roast chicken &amp; jelly for dinner. He has not taken a dose of medicine during this attack. Doct R has avoided every remedy which was not soothing. he has only had a cough mixture, or a sleeping powder the first nights which were most miserable, but great care has been required in his diet. During this fortnight of dear Jemies illness Willie has been profiting by his kind Sisters instructions in the study &amp; by the mild, bright, weather for being upon the Neva skating in the recess. One day I walked down the quai to be a spectator of the English skating ground, &amp; enjoyed it exceedingly it was mild bright weather, the part of the river hedged round by ever greens, is a very large oblong &amp; kept so smooth by scraping &amp; sweeping daily &amp; pouring water over to freeze at night it looks like a clear mirror. I thought our Willies skating very tolerable as he glided across the great sqaure of the English ground upon seeing me standing watching his movements from the quai, he suddenly seated himself upon one of the benches &amp; calling to a Mujic to unstrap his skates he was soon running towards me - to beg for fifteen copeecks silver<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-657-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-657">657</a></span></span> to buy a hockey stick. He reports daily the kindness of the gentlemen skaters in teaching him, &amp; particularly young M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Merriellees<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-658-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-658">658</a></span></span> who condescends to play ball with him. Willie finds it difficult to persuade himself to leave such facinating society to come home in time to be ready four our dinner at four oclock. but he brings a famous relish for it from this fine exercise, indeed Willie has quite regained his bloom this fortnight &amp; I feel that it would be more severe upon me to send my boys back now to school than it was when they entered, for then we were all well - and since then such a blank! besides the experiment has dissappointed our expectations, any advantage in the way of study has been at too great a sacrifice, that of health most apparent, but I tremble also for morals. I beg their father earnestly, that they may remain at home under my care &amp; their gentle Sisters tuition where their habits to virtue will be strengthened, &amp; their gradual progress more sure in the end. We received letters by the Cambria which left Boston on the 1<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span>of this month, last monday. that from our dear George<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-659-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-659">659</a></span></span> has excited an uneasiness which cannot be dissipated until the next steamer a month off yet – may bring us more cheering tidings from our dear Son. May God direct &amp; comfort him &amp; may the next report be that his health is restored. When I allowed Debo the perusal of my dear Mothers letter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-660-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-660">660</a></span></span> to me she remarked as she returned it “how beautifully Grandmother expresses herself &amp; her letters are so full of home details they are the most satisfactory we get” Yes I often think how remarkable such letters are from an old lady of seventy, for the neatness of the caligraphy is as extraordinary as the clearness of the ideas, &amp; original beauty of the sentences. My precious Mother! may we yet enjoy years <span class="CharOverride-1">at home</span> together, when it will be my delightful privilige to smooth away the cares from which I would my honoured parent might be free in the down-hill of life. Oh that I had it in my power to obey the impulses of my heart &amp; cheer her at this distance by contributing to the comforts of my brother Charles. The letters from Irving Place<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-661-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-661">661</a></span></span> told of the “merry Christmas” there, &amp; my dear brother William in the midst of his family circle made their enjoyment without alloy. But what a severe winter they are having in my native land in comparison to ours in Russia thus far, and in England &amp; even in the south of Europe the papers mention more suffering from cold than we have in this really frozen region. but this winter has been even more exempt from winds here than ever, the only day when I have suffered from cold in going out, was the day of the funeral of Miss Funks sister.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-662-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-662">662</a></span></span> we have not had our January thaw either, the sleding has been excellent &amp; the skating on the Neva also, yet mild &amp; blessed as has been this season for the poor (&amp; there are more than usual on the list, from persons out of employment finding it impossible to obtain bread for their families, clothing the Dorcas society<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-663-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-663">663</a></span></span> has bountifully distributed. our friends the Gellibrands &amp; Ropes being most active members - yet the moisture of the atmosphere–which has yeilded us such beautiful frostwork scenes - has not been as wholesome as the clear cold natural to Russia. our doctor has reported more ill than he has known at the beginning of any year before, for it is at the breaking up of the winter the hospitals are most full. Dear old M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Leon is very poorly, the cold she caught in crossing to church on Christmas day has confined her ever since. her friends flock to her, &amp; the poor still obtain admission to pour their tale of sorrow into her sympathising bosom, knowing she will leave no effort untried to interest those who can “go about to do good”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-664-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-664">664</a></span></span> &amp; to distribute.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday morning Feb 6<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span>1847.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-665-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-665">665</a></span></span> During this week I have been so incessantly attending upon my dear Jemie &amp; Deborah as only to have been out once &amp; that was last Monday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-666-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-666">666</a></span></span> to see my respected &amp; beloved old friend M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Leon. I had sent Mary to her several days to evince the regard I felt, for doct Rogers reported her failing strength from day to day. &amp; at 83 years “when the grasshopper proves a burden”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-667-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-667">667</a></span></span> we could scarcely expect even her extraordinarily good constitution to be restored to aught like health. she received me with her usual affection tho it was not easy for her to assume cheerfulness, her cough distressing her &amp; general debility pervading. I offered Marys services by night or day. but as has ever been my own dear Mother - she felt too unwilling to give trouble &amp; has ever been as conspicuous for her neatness and love of order, she embraced me as that dear mother would have done upon my short call being ended tho as I kissed her mouth, she said “Oh dont my dear” I suppose from the dread of infecting me with her cough. The weather had suddenly become so intensely cold (15 deg below zero Farnheit that I could not bear to keep horses or coachman waiting as long as I could have liked to stay besides my invalids at home wanted me. Willie had been seized with one of his attacks of stomach disorder on the evening before &amp; his father had taken him again to be in his room for dear Jemie was not so quiet with me away from him at night. Debo had caught cold in a short walk she took mild as the weather still was on Saturday.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-668-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-668">668</a></span></span> Every body rails at this atmosphere of S<span class="CharOverride-9">t </span>Petersburgh, they say the swamp it is founded upon was never intended for any inhabitants but wolves &amp; bears! certainly people of all classes but especially young girls lose what health they bring to this imperial city &amp; soon assume the appearance of the natives of southern latitudes in my own country. Our dear daughter not feeling able to execise under a fur shube as she would do with garments suited to a less severe climate has become very fragile, losing appetite &amp; inclination to sleep. this slight cold has brought her to such a feeble state we have suffered great anxiety for her this whole week. I divided my time between her room &amp; Jemies, until she became better &amp; he alas much worse, for a blister has been applied to his chest &amp; his nervous irritability returning I have feared to leave his bed-side. he has been almost in a sitting posture in bed that he might have freer respiration, for two nights I have watched his sleeplessness anxiously. And yet uneasy about his dear Sister being left so much alone in her nervous, low state, I felt thankful that she could leave her room yesterday &amp; well cloaked up I brought her to Jemies where I can watch over these two of my hearts treasures during the long night, &amp; they help to cheer each other in the day. Willie is again well enough to come to table, &amp; amuses himself with Mary &amp; Phedocia in the sewing room as he has no lessons this week &amp; the cold has been too intense for anyone to skate. I am thankful to record that it has moderated during the night, my dear husband having been obliged to leave us directly after breakfast to drive to Alexandrofsky, yesterday he was out much in his open sledge &amp; on calling upon Col Kraffts,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-669-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-669">669</a></span></span> he stopped him ere welcoming to have his face rubbed with snow as he detected Jack Frosts finger marks on Whistlers nose &amp; cheeks. our poor Coacher from having been kept hours on his box suffered seriously. my humane husband does not forget man or beast &amp; advised Nicoli to drive into a stable to shelter the ponies &amp; warm himself, but “nichevoo” was the cheerful response of the hardy Russian, and it was not till the exposure to cold in attendance upon his master was over, that he submitted his phiz to our good natured Arnooshka<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-670-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-670">670</a></span></span> for some cooks=grease to soften its frozen condition, the cold happily for him has decreased from 16 to 1 deg Rom– I have wished much to be able to call at the parsonage of the American chapel these few days past, for the sad reports I have of M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ellerbys nursery make me yearn to see her cherub Emily again. that little one so associated with my own angel Johnie, so nearly the same day of their birth, so much resembling each other in beauty &amp; loveliness I cling to, &amp; yet feel how selfish to wish to detain such here below who are “of the kingdom of heaven.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-671-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-671">671</a></span></span> little darling Emmy has been extremely ill from croup &amp; is still. Elizabeth Ropes interrupted me just as I had written this far while they were cleaning Jemies room &amp; I had stationed myself in the Chancellery to write that Willie might amuse himself with painting landscapes to surprise Jemie afterwards - And now it is an hour before our tea time &amp; we are finishing our morning efforts in the drawing-room while his dear father is sitting between the two dear invalids in the far back chamber. I learnt from Elizabeth today of the death of my revered old acquaintance M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Leon.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-672-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-672">672</a></span></span> her last words were to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gellibrand yesterday morning “I hope–I hope!” she gradually became weaker &amp; in the evening when her happy spirit took its flight it was without a throe or a struggle. Doct Rogers was paying his last visit just when the summons came for her departure from this world of trial, he had feared her suffering much at the last, when he saw her yesterday morning. &amp; it must have been a cause of thankfulness to him to witness her peaceful sleep in the arms of death. Doct Rogers was one of the dear old ladys favorites, may God reward him for all his attention to one among the many he attends without earthly compensation. during her illness of last Summer how many times she spoke to me of all his kindness, his respectful attentions, his generous &amp; ingenious pleas for getting all her medicines for her at <span class="CharOverride-1">his</span> apothecaries &amp; then avoiding any settlement with her– at that time God was preparing her for this last sickness no doubt, as her general excellent health was then broken she was obliged to retire more even from her small circle of friends &amp; depend upon the consolations of religion. her dependence upon the righteousness of Christ was entire, she walked humbly with her God &amp; “she did what she could”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-673-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-673">673</a></span></span> in His service, being lowly in her own eyes we have full confidence that He has exalted her to the place prepared for those to whom the Judge will say “well done good &amp; faithful servant enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-674-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-674">674</a></span></span> May my end be like hers. Never while memory lasts shall mine cease to revive the profitable hours I have spent in this dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leons society, for her experience was valuable as was her advice to my children. how fond she was of my little Johnie! &amp; he of Grandma Leon! how shocked she was at my losing him &amp; how soon she has followed him to where all who confess Him <span class="CharOverride-1">here</span>, will be united in Christ Jesus. Doct Rogers who studies every case with great attention was an hour with us today examining our dear James lungs because of many unfavorable symptoms this week, I was detaining a messenger of M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Frank Bairds quite unconscious what the contents of the elegant note<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-675-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-675">675</a></span></span> I held in my hand or from whom, while my heart &amp; head were both aching, as I was engaged in the interesting discussion of my dear boys symptoms, after he had left the sick chamber to question me privately. so many sleepless nights as I have had of late have contributed to make me nervous &amp; I found it a difficult task to answer a polite note of invitation to join a party this evening rather for Debo to join the “at home” at the elegant M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Bairds than myself, for I excused myself from attending any, when she called the other day upon us. I had it in my power then to confer a favor upon her by lending the beautiful new foot stool which M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winans has lately had made for me - as a model for one to secure her against cold feet in driving about, the Bairds have been uniformly attentive to us &amp; I really congratulated myself upon having it in my power to serve this lady who is in delicate health tho so gay &amp; had searched in vain for a foot stove. But as to her parties I politely declined any infringement upon our quiet family=circle=<span class="CharOverride-1">at homes</span>=truly, for Saturday night, expressing a readiness when dear Debos health should admit to meet her convenience for any other of the five evenings of the week. In this &amp; other cities on the continent of Europe where the Lords day is scarcely reserved for sacred duties, I know my Yankee habit of shutting the business &amp; pleasures of the world from my family circle on Saturday evening would be deemed rather strict, yet I cannot but believe it right to do as we pray on the last day of the week, that all worldly cares may be banished from our minds that we may serve the Lord without distraction on His holy day. &amp; surely one cannot attend a gay scene without involving all the injury of late hours (to servants included who surely ought to have their rest after six days labour. “It is written” that the day of the Crucifixion was the Preparation,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-676-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-676">676</a></span></span> the day before the sabbath, and should Christians be careless to take advantage of this observance of Gods peculiar people! Thus it becomes us to fulfil all righteousness,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-677-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-677">677</a></span></span> It is so usual to prepare for any fête day, that even members of Christs flock who participate in these pastimes do as others &amp; give many thoughts &amp; conclude arrangements beforehand, to avoid confusion, or loss of time in entering upon the recreation, even tho new schemes of pleasure succeed they are not indifferent as to the anticipated arrangements. But “the children of this world are wiser in their generation”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-678-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-678">678</a></span></span> &amp; alas there are few indeed of Christs flock who are as persevering in seeking eternal pleasures, as these are in their eager pursuit after evanescent joys which refresh not the votary, who still pursues them in his search after happiness. Oh that the early habits I strive to give my children may secure them from some of the evils arising from temptations to banish preparation for the sabbath from weekly arrangements. if I could perfect my plan Saturday evening should always be reverted to by us all with the most heartfelt satisfaction of all the six evenings of the week. for surely it could not even be condemned by the world that a family circle should unite in improving each other, with so many interesting memoires or histories to read aloud, after which sacred music would yeild variety &amp; excite devotional feeling, to induce a willingness for family devotion &amp; reading a chapter from the best of books. God would bless us, by giving us yeilding us suitable dispositions for enjoying the succeeding Sabbaths.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday [February] 8<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> As my invalids were late in rising I found it impossible to attend public worship but it was more important Mary should hear Doct Laws sermon in aid of her suffering countrymen &amp; the poor Scotch. Our good Doct made his visit early enough to admit of his going to church which he cannot often, because of his number of sick to visit, but as a Scotsman it was a peculiar duty that he should listen to the charity sermon &amp; give of his abundance to the starving of Ireland &amp; Sctoland.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-679-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-679">679</a></span></span> My Willie felt happy in nearly emptying his poors purse that he might put in his mite, &amp; Mary received from Jemie his, to add to her own. My husband reported to us how crowded was the church &amp; how touching the truths revealed by the pastor, on the ladys side sobs were audible &amp; even many men wept. we have heard today of a young lady who took off her watch to put in the poors purse another in the same pew kindly offered to lend her money supposing her unprepared &amp; that she might afterwards regret the sacrifice of her watch &amp; trinkets, no she replied “I do not need it” &amp; quietly yeilded it up among the offerings. the collection was about eighteen hundred siver rubles, but this would be paltry in comparison to the collection of six hundred at the Chapel from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r </span>Ellerbys small &amp; not rich congregation, if it were not understood that the british merchants, who generally belong to D<span class="CharOverride-9">oct</span> Laws church are to meet to deliberate upon measures for more extensive subscriptions. Deborah appeared so much better in the afternoon I went to church leaving Mary to aid her in taking care of dear Jemie who is only able to change from bed to the great arm chair. As I had read &amp; prayed with him &amp; dear Sister in the morning, so after our early tea we had a family service for his benefit in his room. I selected another of Arnolds<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-680-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-680">680</a></span></span> sermons after the reading in the bible &amp; our devotions. And what had the multitude been interested in before the Imperial palace? yesterday was the commencement of the amusements in that great square for this is what is called the butter week, or that preceding Lent. poor deluded people! how imperious is the duty that those who have the lamp of Gods word should let their light shine to guide these darkened souls into the path of wisdom. Oh that the English who can speak in <span class="CharOverride-1">their</span> tongue would venture a word too in season, instead of winking at these errors, &amp; many alas participate in them. May God teach them better ere it be too late.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Tuesday night [February] 9<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-681-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-681">681</a></span></span> Watching by my darling James bedside I incline to avail of the stillness of midnight for recording the mercies of Him who never wearies in His Omniscience. May His holy Spirit fill my soul with adoration ere I seek Him in prayer this night. My precious invalid had more refreshing sleep last night than since his relapse, he had suffered exceedingly the past week from blistering, &amp; pain in his chest &amp; side, which induced debility &amp; restlessness. but yesterday I took a drive with Debo - my last had been a week previous, to visit dear old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon - today at noon Whistler &amp; I went to her funeral!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-682-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-682">682</a></span></span> it was very respectably attended. many wept to think they should see her in this world no more! M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gellibrand her constant friends these many years past, were among the mourners. I drove after the funeral to enquire at the parsonage of the Chapel, how M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ellerbys darling baby did &amp; was thankful to find her improving. On my return home Debo took some young friends a long drive in our sledge, the weather was so mild &amp; bright, she looked quite revived by it, tho still she is feeble &amp; pale. Willie having been a good boy at his books with Sister during the morning, also went out, &amp; preferred walking with Mary, that he might see the amusements in the square. They met the other two little Ellerbys &amp; their nice English nursery maid, who has so long been shut up with the sick baby she must have been glad of the walk with the elder two little girls. It is time for me to seek my pillow tho I am not inclined to sleep. how refreshing it is to me to watch the sweet slumber James has fallen into, he has not looked so natural in a long time, since this attack his sitting posture, propped by many pillows &amp; his extreme palor has recalled his illness in Stonington<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-683-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-683">683</a></span></span> to my minds eye. with thankfulness that this has been less severe tonight it was my painful task to apply <span class="CharOverride-1">the pomade</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-684-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-684">684</a></span></span> upon his chest where the blister has just healed. how hard for a mother to give pain to a child! which she would wish to screen from all suffering by any endurance herself. But our heavenly Fathers ordains the trial for us both. May He bless the means for my dear boys recovery. &amp; sanctify the discipline to us both. Never can I cease to recal with joy the spirit of cheerful submission of my darling James to his privations in this back chamber, consecrated as it has become by scenes of trial to me. Especially yesterday his unmurmuring endurance of confinement while Willie was enjoying all the spectacle of the Carnival. he was so free from envy.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday evening. Feb 27<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-685-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-685">685</a></span></span> The occasional replies to letters, or daily notes which could not without rudeness be avoided, has been the only writing I could attend to without depriving James of my participation in his enjoyments, for whether reading, or looking thro books of engravings he has so much more satisfaction from my listening to his remarks, that unless when I have engaged his interest in some of my own reading aloud to him, he has claimed mine in the little vanity afforded him in the back room. Each evening between dinner &amp; tea for some days I indulged him with a tale relating to a family in New York, because it combines instruction with amusement. “Hoboken” by M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Fay<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-686-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-686">686</a></span></span> now Secretary of our legation at the court of Prussia displays principles of the highest order, &amp; has my best wishes for doing its proportion of good in discountenancing duelling &amp; in supporting the argument of scripture that the fear of God, &amp; the love of immortal souls, is the course of true courage &amp; honor. If God spares the life of my boys I trust they will never forget the lessons early instilled &amp; that they may dare to confess themselves Christians. that they may not by acting <span class="CharOverride-1">without</span> asking Gods direction in prayer upon each stirring event, bring the curse of remorse upon their souls. Never shall I cease to record with thankfulness dear Jemies unmurmuring submission these six weeks of his suffering confinement, the doct does not yet consent to using his pencil, which is a great privation - but while pain lingers as it still does in his chest, my darling patient himself agrees that his favorite pastime may be injurious. he begins now to walk some about his room. tho still cannot wear jacket &amp; trowsers, as the blistering is continued on the chest. I altered a dressing gown (which had descended from me to his sister, doing excellent service from the date of his own birth) &amp; it fits him so nicely, he is delighted to wear it when he sits up &amp; says it is “first rate”. What a blessing is such a contented temper as his, he is so grateful for every kindness, &amp; scarcely ever expresses a complaint. his sweet Sister - in whose visits to his chamber he delights - borrowed for him a huge volume of Hogarths engravings<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-687-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-687">687</a></span></span> - of those pictures so famous in the gallery of artistes, we place the immense book on the bed &amp; draw M<span class="CharOverride-9">r </span>Maxwells great easy chair close up that dear Jemie may feast upon it without fatigue. I expressed surprise to hear him say yesterday while thus engaged, “Oh! how I wish I were well” &amp; said to him I hoped he was not getting impatient of seclusion. “Oh no Mother! he answered cheerfully, “I was only thinking how glad I should be to shew this book of engravings to my drawing master, it is not every one who has a chance of seeing Hogarths own engravings of his originals. &amp; then he added in his own happy way “And if I had not been ill Mother, perhaps no one would have thought of shewing them to me” his dear, kind father is now teaching him chess while I occupy the drawing<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-688-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-688">688</a></span></span> alone, before tea. I sat by Jemie after dinner, reading him M<span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Maxwells letter received by todays mail, it contained the touching account of his having attended to the interment of our precious Johnies body. he had taken it to Stonington himself, thus adding to his friendly actions towards us.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-689-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-689">689</a></span></span> I have looked forward thro this whole month to the treat of letters from home by the Steamer of the 1<span class="CharOverride-9U">st</span> if my Mother or Kate wrote, it was too late for the mail probably, as Whistler &amp; Debo have many letters from New York. thus deprived of my private supply of home news, I am the more indebted to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell for his particular mention of all at the dear corner house, all well! hospitable &amp; kind, Doct P – he calls “a fine fellow, his wife one of the amiable &amp; excellent kind, his children such pictures of health it did his heart good to look at them, &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span> N their grandmother an astonishing lady”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-690-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-690">690</a></span></span> So now I must hope on thro another long month to see the welcome hand writing of either mother, or Sister. When my head presses my pillow this night I may visit in memory the resting place of our boys at Stonington! for night by night it is my melancholy indulgence to recal them from their narrow beds there to surround me, I think of them as they were, &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">as they are</span>! yearning to go to them, yet trying only to wish that God may give me grace to improve my alotted term this side the grave, to be ready to follow them. I suppose I have the same desire for heavenly scenes, as my enthusiastic little Jemie has for travelling thro Italy, Egypt &amp;c, yet when looking thro a volume of American sketches today to gratify him, I felt natural longings to visit the beautiful places of our own native land with my children, &amp; to see again ere I bid adieu to earth, the many I love there, tho so painfully feeling this four years separation from Mother, Sisters &amp; friends, my most forvent hope is that our hearts are united in love to our Saviour then we shall have consolation, even if death overtake us, that our meeting shall be in heavenly mansions, to part no more, forever! &amp; ever. Ah how can any one professing to love Jesus, so love this worlds enticements as to let its follies, prevent their honoring Him supremely before all the world! “Who so loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-691-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-691">691</a></span></span> Ah do those who indulge in worldy vanities, forget the divine admonition “to strive to enter in at the straight gate, &amp; to keep the narrow path?”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-692-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-692">692</a></span></span> “Be ye seperate from the world.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-693-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-693">693</a></span></span> Holy Spirit quicken us in repentence unto newness of life!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-694-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-694">694</a></span></span> My excellent friend M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Gellibrand who is ever active in benevolence &amp; christian duty has added to her routine, since the death of our respected M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Leon, the settlement of her affairs, as the beloved old lady had outlived all her relatives M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> G seem most interested to execute her wishes, her furniture &amp; clothing to be sold for the poor or distributed to the few of her pensioners.

M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gellibrand wishes some one could write the memoires of this remarkable old lady, it would indeed be very interesting, even the few items I have become intimate with, will ever be pleasant reminiscences, because I shall always associate her own lively manner &amp; intellectual remarks, her high regard for traits of good encountered in her extensive knowledge of the world.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-696-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-696">696</a></span></span> she was the neice of the discoverer of Vaccination, Doct Jenner<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-697-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-697">697</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>- her maiden name having been the same, when a very young girl - she was an only child &amp; her father a man of superior endowments had educated her with undivided attention to intellectual accomplishments - while her mother added practical instruction in the art of housewifery &amp;c - she accompanied her Uncle to Paris &amp; was so much in the same circle as our <span class="CharOverride-1">Franklin</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-698-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-698">698</a></span></span> who was them American ambassador at the court of France, that he always addressed her as his child, she could relate many anecdotes connected with the sufferings of the Royal family of Louis 16<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> &amp; had been eye witness to many exciting scenes of public interest. Whether she was introduced at the court in either of her visits to the french capital I did not ascertain, but her usual deportment shewed she had been accustomed to the best society. Her husband was an officer in the British Army, she lived in the West Indies &amp; at other stations abroad, &amp; her travels used to remind me of those of my own Mother. Upon the death of her father, her husband &amp; her children, her aged mother having only a limited income, &amp; herself without independent support, she sought to make her talents useful &amp; was recommended by a lady of her acquaintance among the English nobility, to a very distinguished Polish family<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-699-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-699">699</a></span></span> who were then seeking an English governess for their daughter Olga. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon went to their princely home in Poland where they remained awhile, but eventually came to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg to complete the education of their children. they occupied a Palace<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-700-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-700">700</a></span></span> - which is now converted into a charitable institution, for it is forty years since the beautiful Countess gave her fêtes there - thus M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon was accustomed to meet the court circle of Imperial S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg for she was usually mistress of ceremonies, she was familiar with the reigns of Paul &amp; of Alexander as of the present Emperor &amp; abounded in anecdotes of each in turn. she never wearied of talking about the graces of mind &amp; person of the beautiful, the charitable, the generous high-minded noble Countess. &amp; was enthusiastic in her admiration &amp; attachment to her own pupil Olga. but at the time this noble family must leave S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P to travel, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon met with a fall, which caused a temporary lameness &amp; prevented her accompanying them. Tho a sad dissappointment to her at the time, no doubt it will be seen in the state of rewards in a world where trials are fully comprehended – that it was wisely ordered that her prosperity should be darkened that her whole dependence might be placed on her Saviour. For her savings also thro the dishonesty of an agent were lost to her – and she had in every situation of her life managed to contribute to the comforts of her mother – As she never of course gave me any direct narrative of her chequered life, of course I cannot be sure, but I think she took a situation in the Naarishkin<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-701-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-701">701</a></span></span> family upon her recovery from the sprain which had been so serious as to confine her two years. during which period of privation she realized the comfort of having many true friends among her own Countrymen here. </p>

The Metropolitan or Pope of the Greek church with all the high Clergy preceded the gorgeously decorated hearse, all of them walking in solemn procession bare=headed with their long hair flowing in the wind, the Metropolitan only, wore a jewelled crown, about twenty orders which had been worn no doubt with pride by the distinguished man whom the Emperor had delighted to honor – were carried by as many officers of rank, upon scarlet, or crimson, velvet cushions. the coffin was covered with scarlet &amp; gold, a high canopy of gilded ornament exposing it to view. The Emperor crossed himself repeatedly as he gave a last look at the remains of his faithful old friend, for the weather did not encourage him to follow in the procession to the Smolna Monastery,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-710-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-710">710</a></span></span> where the burial was appointed, he therefore stationed himself at the head of the Nevski (leading to his own palace &amp; received the salute of the cavalry as they passed after the hearse, we had an excellent view of him as he was thus motionless as a statue for about fifteen minutes, his brother the Grand Duke Michel, the Herétier, the Count Klienmichel &amp; others of the Imperial family around him. The Emperor &amp; suite dashed down the Nevski as soon as the procession crossed it, servants stationed there took their horses while they no doubt were glad to take to their equipages which had been in waiting, for the cold was intense. Willie &amp; I were twice glad when we reached our home, that we had seen so grand a pageant &amp; that it was over, for our faces were nearly frost bitten. I had never had so satisfactory a sight of the magnificent Emperor before, so close to him &amp; for such a length of time. when I reached home, I was welcomed by dear Jemie, who has all this week gone to the drawing room for half the day, his father was keeping him company on the sofa, from having caught a severe cold some days before indeed Debo &amp; I will not soon forget when her dear father was detained from us so many anxious hours when we had waited dinner &amp; tea in vain, and at last midnight overtook us &amp; we were still watching &amp; fearing some sad accident, he reached our fire side at one oclock, had had nothing to eat from early breakfast with us, until midnight at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Harrisons at Alexandrofsky, tho only a snow drift on a part of the rail road from thence to Colpina had detained them,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-711-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-711">711</a></span></span> I hoped he might be spared another day of such exposure to cold, the poor Russians who work on the road are all serfs, badly clad &amp; not in any way efficient, they are whipped if they run into difficulties in working the Engine which thro their ignorance they often do &amp; no rewards are held out to them if they do better, their fare black bread &amp; salt, yet Whistler says he never saw more cheerful fellows, tho those who understand them best – Russians themselves – say they are but ye<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-712-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-712">712</a></span></span> servants &amp; must be watched &amp; beaten. but Whistler thinks they must – to succeed with their road – adopt a more civilized system.

The very possibility of such an event makes my heart bound homeward! &amp; I do trust every facility will be given to the progress of the work henceforward. it is the only favor I would ask the Emperor.

The Cars, the Locomotives, the shops &amp; the hundreds of workmen appearing to the best advantage, were subjects by turns of the Emperors eulogium, when he spoke of the latter as fine fellows he added “but they will get drunk sometimes! what a pity they make beasts of themselves!” The day after his visit to the American works.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-724-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-724">724</a></span></span> the Count held a levee, my husband having been invited, went with a supply of documents for the Count supposing (as he had previously urged despatch) they would be demanded but by the advice of his friend Col Melnikoff, put them in a corner till called for.

I thanked them for the seats we were allowed to retain, ere we left their pew. dear Jemie was so fatigued we took him back to our hotel &amp; left him on the sofa to rest, while I took Willie &amp; Mary to “All Saints church” but we were an hour too early &amp; thinking that we must allot time for a good nights rest in anticipation of our early start, we felt obliged to leave this very old church tho I longed to worship in it &amp; to profit by the eloquence of its pastor We reached Scarbro<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-768-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-768">768</a></span></span> to breakfast. went in the 2<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span> class carriages tho Jemies pride was wounded by so doing. I was much diverted by the talk among the farmers who were our fellow travellers, and glad to hear there never was a better prospect of fine crops in England than this season.

I shall begin this second day of our visit to this bathing place a review of the interval, during which I have been either too unwell to write more than my correspondence with absent dear ones required, or I have been visiting different friends who have interfered with this task. But my Sister Alicia advises me to take this opportunity for scribbling my thoughts, for she has companions in my boys &amp; I am not quite strong enough to brave the high wind, which they say puts them in a glow as they walk upon the beach, the surf is rages. often during the last night the roaring of the waves awoke me &amp; when I came down to breakfast this morning, Betty<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-779-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-779">779</a></span></span> expressed the fear that our good Mary had felt the sea too rough on her voyage from Ireland to Liverpool, she left Preston more than a month ago to visit her native land, &amp; wrote of her wish to return about this time, May God bring her in safety to us! the day before she went, she was most devoted to me for I was obliged to keep my bed, the chills which had been daily creeping thro me, ended in fever, but tho some gentle doses of medicine prescribed by doctor Winstanley<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-780-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-780">780</a></span></span> in a measure relieved me, it was not till we were obliged to summon a surgeon<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-781-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-781">781</a></span></span> to Jemie when we were on a visit at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Picards<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-782-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-782">782</a></span></span> in Kirby Lonsdale,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-783-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-783">783</a></span></span> that my symptoms were deemed serious enough to warrant calomel,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-784-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-784">784</a></span></span> for my Sister Eliza had made up her mind my ailment was mental, it was not so entirely, for ever since that time I have been gradually gaining strength &amp; my appetite is now as good as need be. How favored have we been in a fine season! &amp; how abundant the provision for the suffering state of this country, made by the bountiful Giver, in this fruitful season, such crops of hay as we have seen gathered in are indeed unusual &amp; now the corn fields are as promising of plenty, while the potatoe fields are yeilding <span class="CharOverride-1">healthy</span> crops, &amp; every green vegetable is cheap in the markets.

I had heard this man of God 17 years ago! My boys attention was rivetted &amp; they did not forget the preaching of this eloquent Irish clergyman. for some weeks afterwards when we attended Worsley church at the seat of the Earl of Ellesmere &amp; we had as impressive a discourse, they seem pleased to discover the preacher there also was an Irish protestant,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-789-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-789">789</a></span></span> But I must go back to the Sunday at Walton (which is only three miles from Preston) that I may not only record it as my darling Jemies 13<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> birth day. but dwell upon the hospitality extended to us from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Swainsons<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-790-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-790">790</a></span></span> family, we lunched at his house &amp; as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span>G is his son in law profited by his conversation between services &amp; went back to the family pew<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-791-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-791">791</a></span></span> to hear him preach to a full congregation of poor - in the afternoon again. We resisted an invitation to dinner for five oclock as we preferred returning home to tea. We walked thro green meadows &amp; by the Ribble side. Aunt E had taken my boys home in her carriage, so Aunt A &amp; I had a delightful tète a tète upon the comforts of religion &amp; I was not fatigued by my first long walk. my boys reported to me that they had gone to Uncle Ws pew alone in the afternoon, as Aunt E could not leave her guest M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> T Ainsworth<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-792-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-792">792</a></span></span> alone all day, &amp; when I heard too that many had called to pay their compliments to her, I was the more thankful I had been with those who had held religious counsel all day. both M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> MacGrath &amp; her sister in law M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> W Swainson<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-793-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-793">793</a></span></span> tho young &amp; beautiful appear decided followers of the Lord Jesus.

Willie &amp; Jemie rode by turns on the dickey with me. &amp; George had much to say to us, for he is still a very important personage in the household of Uncle W. having been in his service thirty years. his wife Mary is one of the best attendants upon table I ever met with &amp; her plate is the admiration of all the visiters at her masters table, she made herself equally useful at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Picards, where we were welcomed to an early tea. We had set out exactly at seven oclock from Preston after a very early breakfast, &amp; as was it was in the hottest weather we have experienced, we rested three hours at Lancaster, which gave us leisure to go into the old church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-801-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-801">801</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>- for it happened to be open for morning prayers - &amp; to look at the monument to the memory of L Richmonds mother in this church yard.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-802-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-802">802</a></span></span> but I am in error, now I recollect this visit to the old church at Lancaster was on our return from Kirby Lonsdale I ought not to forget that upon our journey to Westmoreland, neither Jemie or I were well enough to walk about Lancaster in the heat of the day, tho he wished much to persuade Aunt Eliza to allow himself &amp; Willie to go to the court house<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-803-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-803">803</a></span></span> where he had seen a mob gathere &amp; where he understood a case was to be tried. to divert him from this fancy, she persuaded him she wished him to take her likeness,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-804-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-804">804</a></span></span> &amp; fell asleep while sitting for it to him! she pronounced it very satisfactory &amp; lest it should be rubbed out (for it was in a book of Willies, she washed the page with milk &amp; as I should have expected soiled it completely We stopped to bate the horses<span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>at a village called Hornby between Lancaster &amp; Kirby L &amp; had time to walked thro the beautiful grounds around the Castle of the same name,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-805-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-805">805</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>we followed the course of the river Lune upon which Lancaster is situated all our journey. “the crook of the Lune” is famed for its beauty, &amp; from this point the route became more &amp; more attractive enclosed by hills &amp; abounding in wood, rich fields of grain, or meadow land, “it was hay making season” &amp; the air was perfumed. Kirby Lonsdale is most beautifully situated upon the Lune, embosomed in hills, tho excepting the church which is surrounded by its burying ground<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-806-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-806">806</a></span></span> &amp; on the river bank, the town itself is not picturesque.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-807-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-807">807</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Picards house I remarked before it was pointed out as the home of my old friend Elizabeth W<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-808-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-808">808</a></span></span> as the nicest looking in the street, central yet not public, she stood at her door to welcome us &amp; to introduce me as the only stranger to her husband, their only child a little fellow in his fifth year,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-809-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-809">809</a></span></span> was soon on the most intimate terms with the “little boys” as he styled Jemie &amp; Willie. they went to the river side to fish together day by day or played horse thro the garden. &amp; were equally sorry when the last days companionship came round. I could not tempt my boys from their gambols with little John Richard, to accompany our large party in the carriage or on foot upon the various excursions we made in the environs of Kirby. one afternoon indeed Willie went to the ornamented grounds of Casterton,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-810-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-810">810</a></span></span> for “Lala” or Isabel Simpson<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-811-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-811">811</a></span></span> - took Johnie &amp; we found room to squeeze his little cousins Mary &amp; Meggie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-812-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-812">812</a></span></span> in the carriage, as only Miss Simpson went besides my sister E &amp; I. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Picard remained at home with the gents &amp; Jemie chose to be with them. the children were far more intent upon finding wild strawberries on the sides of the elevation, than upon views, the garden was like a fairy scene, for it was the height of the season for roses. Each successive afternoon my sister ordered the carriage to some new point over at Casterton, the village connected with the lordly manor &amp; called by the same name is like a picture with its neat cottages covered with vines &amp; their little flower gardens enclosing each. the schools &amp; church of Casterton are far famed,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-813-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-813">813</a></span></span> but the reality exceeded all the descriptions I had listened to, they are situated on very high ground, yet hills rise far above them, the grounds under cultivation are very extensive, &amp; the variety of flowers the verdure of wood &amp; meadow surrounding the chaste style of architecture made it indeed like fairy land. we walked around the pretty church which seems rather in a flower garden than burial ground, tho in fact the beds are infants graves - for an infant. school is connected with that for the education of the daughters of indigent clergymen- &amp; some black marble tomb stones marked the resting places of some taken in their youth to Eternity. yet flowers bloomed gaily &amp; roses of every variety were trained around their graves. The owner of Casterton<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-814-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-814">814</a></span></span> having understood from our surgeon<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-815-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-815">815</a></span></span> that strangers - guests of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Picard - were admirers of his great taste &amp; his benevolent spirit - sent thro M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Whitaker an invitation to us to ascend still higher his elevated &amp; highly ornamented grounds, even to visit his gardens enclosing his own lordly mansion &amp; to see his conservatories, as his roses were in perfection, we could not resist the temptation &amp; spent the last afternoon in wandering about them &amp; certainly were amply repaid for any exertion. I cannot enumerate the variety of roses in that parterre, but there was every shade &amp; size from almost black, to pure white, from the tiny Scotch hundred leaf to the Cabbage, some hung in festoons, some covered bowers &amp; every bed was luxuriant. we drove from Casterton to the other side of Kirby to call upon some ladies<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-816-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-816">816</a></span></span> who had invited us to tea, &amp; here I found more to interest me, in the bee hives. we had scarcely returned to the town when one of the Misses Tomlinson sent a servant laden with their honied spoils, a tin case filled with virgin honey in the white comb. <span class="CharOverride-1">for my share</span> I was much obliged. This same kind hearted spinster had given my Sister an engraving to send me because of its resemblance to my angel Charlie.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-817-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-817">817</a></span></span> It was the wish of Sister Eliza that I should thank Miss T when she first called to see us, but I could not do so in general conversation, &amp; ere I could wait to whisper it apart to the stranger, my Sister had anticipated me. I have not attempted to describe the comforts we participated in, at Elizabeths home, but should choose if I might, for my family such a snuggery, it is a stone house with three parlors &amp; a front kitchen on the first floor. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ware<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-818-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-818">818</a></span></span> the widowed Sister of Elizabeth calls one of the sitting rooms hers &amp; furnishes it, with the sleeping room above it, which in her absence at Harrogate myself &amp; boys occupied, these look out into the garden &amp; therefore I was charmed had been selected for such a lover of flowers as I am. My old friends the Misses Simpson<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-819-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-819">819</a></span></span> of Edinburgh call Elizabeths house their home. “Lala” is the governess of the three little cousin Picards.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-820-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-820">820</a></span></span> During our visit Jemie attempted the portraits of even the three nice servant maids.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-821-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-821">821</a></span></span> &amp; Johnie was induced to stand as a model,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-822-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-822">822</a></span></span> by the promise of two of the largest Strawberries in his fathers garden. I never saw such fruit as that bed yeilded, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Picard cultivate their neat garden themselves &amp; its plentiful produce rewards their industry. We had a dessert each day of fine cherries or strawberries gathered by their own hand. cucumbers from their hot bed - excellent head lettuce, new potatoes - green peas, all of their own planting &amp; picking. I shall always associate Elizabeth with tranquil home-scenes-&amp; luxuriant natural scenery - for when I visited her 17 years ago she was the comfort of her widowed mother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-823-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-823">823</a></span></span> &amp; North Gate<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-824-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-824">824</a></span></span> was situated in Wensledale one of the loveliest valleys of Yorkshire. During our late visit at Kirby one day in alluding to her suffering sea sickness if riding in a close carriage, her husband laughed &amp; said “Elizabeth was not formed to be a fine lady” “no no! Richard that she was not was her smiling response she was to be your wife &amp; she envies no one” Often have I watched her devoted fondness towards this gude mon of hers with painful interest, for I am told she has deep anxieties for his health, tho he is a picture of manly beauty in the prime of life, his lungs are not sound it is feared.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-825-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-825">825</a></span></span> This world is not our home, even such an earthly paradise as Kirby Lonsdale is not secure from the destroyer. But if trials assail Elizabeth, her trust I know is in God. Tho little John Richard threatened to break Uncle Ws carriage or lame his horses, yet we had to leave on the friday morning<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-826-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-826">826</a></span></span> of that happy week. And right glad was Aunt Alicia to welcome us in the Preston home to tea that same night. Jemie has since, received a flattering proof that he made friends at Kirby, for the kind surgeon there M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Whitaker has written<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-827-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-827">827</a></span></span> to ask his young patient to return to make him a visit, I had read in the countenance of both physician &amp; Jemie a mutual love at first sight, for M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W has no boy of his own,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-828-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-828">828</a></span></span> &amp; confessed to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winstanley how lively an interest James excited. Many thanks for his prescriptions to us both, for he administered judiciously to my case as to James. by his recommendation I should have sought a sea side retreat immediately but an invitation to visit my friends at Chadock Hall<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-829-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-829">829</a></span></span> first induced me on Wednesday the 14<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-830-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-830">830</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>inst to set out from Preston with my Sister Alicia &amp; boys by the 4 oclock afternoon train, we reached the Astley station<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-831-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-831">831</a></span></span> in an hour &amp; found a cart awaiting our luggage &amp; old Peter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-832-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-832">832</a></span></span> coming forward from the pony phaeton to meet us, but my adventurous boys must have surprised Miss Smiths steady old coach man, for he was scarcely off his seat ere they occupied it &amp; had reins &amp; whip in hand, even I accustomed as I am to their sudden movements was astounded &amp; as the ponys head was turned towards Chadock I almost expected he would take them there without us. Old Peter laughed good humouredly &amp; restored order. he is a great contrast to George at Preston<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-833-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-833">833</a></span></span> certainly, for he allowed the young mad caps to drive by turns, notwithstanding their having attempted it before asking permission. Cordial was the welcome awaiting our arrival at the old Hall from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Rob<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Smith, my dear friend Anne &amp; her two sweet young neices &amp; protége<span class="CharOverride-1" lang="ar-SA">és</span> Mary &amp; Bessie,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-834-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-834">834</a></span></span> whom I had not seen since they were little girls, for 17 years had elapsed since my last visit to Chadock. in that time they had lost their parents, &amp; they reward Aunt Anne for every sacrifice she has made to devote herself to them, by contributing as they do every hour now to her comfort. Bessie the youngest looks too fragile to endure the storms of an earthly pilgrimage, those she has known have depressed her young bouyancy of spirit &amp; she is habitually pensive, I saw many proofs of her deep piety during the week I was at Chadock, &amp; believe Mary to be equally pious, tho her firmer health yeilds her a greater stock of cheerfulness. she would be in her sphere as a clergymans wife is some village,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-835-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-835">835</a></span></span> for these dear girls shrink from the bustle of a town life. they go hand in hand as Aunt Annes housekeepers alternately, or in works of charity, their recreations are reading aloud to her or to each other over embroidery, or Bessies wax flower making, but I observed they began every day directly after breakfast by the study of Gods word, they regularly retired to their own room together, to read from the same bible, &amp; it was the last subject with the trio before retiring at night. If I had lost my full appreciation of the value of time in a four years. absence from a land of gospel light, I have been brought to reflection by the example of these consciencious young disciples. How very often I wished dear Debo had been with us that week at Chadock. The country around it tho so entirely unlike Kirby Lonsdale was as charming to me, we were favored in a continuance of fine bright weather for daily walks or drives. it is a fine farming district, &amp; a plain so very extensive, would perhaps have wanted variety but for the shades of green, in the newly mown fields, contrasted with waving wheat, barley and oats, with their rich hawthorn hedges separating them &amp; the quantity of wood land interspersed, the trees are many of them very large, &amp; with the help of fancy I could imagine the ocean in the distance, for the tallest looked like a fleet in the distance. Often in our rambles we would see partridges or rabbits or pheasants, for the Earl of Ellesmere<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-836-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-836">836</a></span></span> has much game on his estate &amp; all the neighbourhood around Chadock Hall is his property. himself &amp; his Countess<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-837-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-837">837</a></span></span> are deservedly beloved for they are promoters of improvement in the condition of the poor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-838-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-838">838</a></span></span> all around there, he has built a new castle at Worsley<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-839-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-839">839</a></span></span> since I first knew the neighbourhood, &amp; the prettiest new church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-840-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-840">840</a></span></span> within walking distance of it I ever examined. it was at evening service there my boys discovered the preacher by his earnestness &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">idiom</span> to be Irish.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-841-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-841">841</a></span></span> but Mary Smith had interested me so much in the rightful &amp; youthful incumbent<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-842-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-842">842</a></span></span> that I cannot help wishing his health may be restored &amp; that the temporary pastor may preach the word in some other parish. it is a nephew of M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƨ</span> Sherwood<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-843-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-843">843</a></span></span> who was first appointed to the Earl of Ellesmeres chapel. but premonitory symptoms of consumption have driven him to the south of Europe for this year, she engaged the heart of an orphan who was in her voyage from India bereft of all her natural protectors by ship wreck,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-844-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-844">844</a></span></span> her fathers wealth was in the English funds. may she have the open hand of Charity to secure her a heavenly interest, from all I learn of the ladies of Ellesmere she will have good examples. We had been within the pretty chapel during one of our strolls in the week &amp; I had observed a printed notice in each pew, requesting all the congregation to unite in the devotions, the responses &amp; if possible in singing the praises of God. And as we entered on sunday evening<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-845-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-845">845</a></span></span> just after the service commenced it seemed one burst of praise. the seats are all free &amp; all were filled. we had some of us driven in the pony phaeton so Anne, my Sister &amp; I walked home with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Rob<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> &amp; Bessie took my boys in the carriage. I was not fatigued, tho my boys had gone to their nest when we reached Chadock. for Jemie had walked both morning &amp; afternoon to the Ellesmere Chapel 1 1/4 mile distance &amp; I had desired they should wait to bid me good night after my experiment. The air is certainly better for me at Chadock than here at the Ocean, but my boys enjoy the bathing, &amp; I hope it may be for their good we came hither.</p>

Let me first record my own restoration to health, for in the search, writing &amp; reading have been neglected. &amp; while I regret not having been able to note down in succession the scenes we have passed thro, the many dear friends we have visited &amp; who have visited us, I feel that it would have been wrong to have tied myself to the desk. While at the cottage at South Shore my dear Sister &amp; Brother Winstanley came to spend a few days with us, bringing the carriage load. the boys could scarcely wait till it stopped for them to give three cheers. &amp; how glad we all were to see our own Mary<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-847-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-847">847</a></span></span> on the dickey with George &amp; his wife. Jemie said we had a feast day, that day for so many good things were brought to add to the good things we had provided in expectation of their coming to dinner. to hominy &amp; fresh milk was added the luxury of cream &amp; fresh Eggs in abundance for breakfast. the boys lamented when their indulgent Uncle &amp; Aunt must leave us &amp; cousin Anne Clunie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-848-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-848">848</a></span></span> went too! Jemie wished to have gone back with them <span class="CharOverride-1">home</span>. but I thought we must fulfil our fortnight.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-849-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-849">849</a></span></span> I must not forget to mention the day we all went to dine at the rectory at Poulton.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-850-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-850">850</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> John Hull<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-851-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-851">851</a></span></span> were so kind &amp; hospitable &amp; their governess<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-852-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-852">852</a></span></span> entered into all the sports of the children, our boys seemed to win her admiration the weather was most propitious, so that the games were all upon the green sward under large walnut trees &amp; as we older folks sat at the window we shared the enjoyment. How almost enviable I thought M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Hulls lot, such a home, so retired from bustle yet so conveniently situated for her husbands duties he need scarcely be gone an hour from her, &amp; their large family (Lucy the eldest only the age of our Jemie)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-853-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-853">853</a></span></span> all so bright &amp; so dutiful &amp; so fond! We went to see the church,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-854-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-854">854</a></span></span> where there is an elegant monument to the memory of the father of the pastor - my kind friend old Doctor Hull<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-855-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-855">855</a></span></span> of Manchester is buried at Poulton his native town. At dinner we had very fine fruit, but the children who had been allowed the favor of coming to table, were considerately released at dessert, that they might gather theirs in the garden, where all sorts of ripe berries abounded. we afterwards joined them there. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">We went often to see poor old Aunt Wilkin<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-856-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-856">856</a></span></span> at Black Pool where she resides with her daughter Priscilla, who married an honest carrier,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-857-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-857">857</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>&amp; takes lodgers thro the summer, for their house is finely situated on the beach. How many solitary musings I had in my strolls upon that long beach at low tide! when the dear boys were amusing themselves with bow &amp; arrows. or on donkeys or in throwing stones as far as they could send them into the surf. But the last bathe was taken the second saturday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-858-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-858">858</a></span></span> there &amp; we had a fine afternoon to return bag &amp; baggage to Preston. My Sister Eliza &amp; kind M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W were waiting at the Station to welcome us. &amp; had scarcely done so, ere they were met by one of the servants telling them Sir James Wemess<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-859-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-859">859</a></span></span> was at the house. he afterwards went again with as many as could make the exertion, back to the station to see M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Ormerod<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-860-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-860">860</a></span></span> passing thro, for my part I was obliged to lie down on the sofa after my journey, until tea time. It is surprising how much fatigue my Sister goes thro, tho she cannot now bear the excitement of entertaining many at a time as she used to do. there is an incessant demand upon her hospitality &amp; sympathies. each day she regularly visits an infirm old lady to cheer her in a sick chamber. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Walton<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-861-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-861">861</a></span></span> would feel alarmed if she staid away without sending word that something extraordinary prevented it. this grateful old lady is continually racking her brain to think what she can find for M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Winstanley! &amp; her amiable daughter Agness<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-862-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-862">862</a></span></span> delights in inventing &amp; seconding these little surprises of her invalid mother. My sister laughs &amp; asks the old lady if she fancies she has a <span class="CharOverride-1">poor look</span>? &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r </span>Winstanley advises Eliza to take a basket of her arm, for seldom two days elapse without her bringing home some nice thing insisted upon. We had not long time alotted for Preston upon our return from South Shore ere the day was fixed by my friends in Liverpool for my visit to Cambridge S<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʊ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-863-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-863">863</a></span></span> poor Jemie had left undone much which he applied himself to accomplishing the last day. there was a sketch of Aunt Winnie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-864-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-864">864</a></span></span> promised to Miss Clunie.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-865-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-865">865</a></span></span> &amp; a beautiful engraving of Miss Waltons<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-866-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-866">866</a></span></span> long waiting to be copied, he did copy the old hermit at his devotions<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-867-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-867">867</a></span></span> very correctly, tho he had only a common pencil &amp; fools cap paper. Aunt Eliza said she should have it framed. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">I set out for Liverpool with my boys only, as Aunt Alicia could not leave Preston until her cousin should to return to Scotland, &amp; we had no time to lose. I was glad to have enjoyed the society of Cousin Anne Clunie three weeks in all. for I have always loved her &amp; she is a true christian.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Dear Eliza &amp; John Sandland were waiting for us at the Edge Hill station,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-868-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-868">868</a></span></span> &amp; soon we were driven to the snug home of their dear mother. how warm &amp; comforting was the embrace of this friend of my youth. “Oh how like you are what your dear mother was when I first saw her!” she said to me when she had told me over &amp; over how glad she felt to see myself &amp; boys. I found M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Sandland looking so interesting fair after her severe illness, that tho so delicate in appearance she seemed to have become younger, her hair is still beautiful &amp; her eyes looked less dejected than they had been many years ago they must be always beautiful. she was wearing blue ribbons on her blond cap – but now alas she is again in deep mourning, for within this last week both M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Jno Grayson &amp; his sister Bessie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-869-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-869">869</a></span></span> have been released by death from great suffering, they died happy! speaking of their trust in an all sufficient Saviour, &amp; dear MSandland is now at Roby<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-870-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-870">870</a></span></span> comforting her bereaved relatives – I shall ever treasure up the memories of kindnesses experienced daily at 10 Cambridge S<span class="CharOverride-9U">t</span> my friends made myself &amp; boys so much at home. John Sandland seemed to feel he could not be too condescending to Jemie &amp; Willie &amp; devoted himself to their amusement, even to country strolls to help them fly their kite. he had reminiscences of my making a pet of him when I was a school girl &amp; he a “little one”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-871-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-871">871</a></span></span> And he was so partial to my boys as to fancy them more intelligent than lads of their age are generally. he showed them the Docks. took them to the Assizes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-872-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-872">872</a></span></span> to hear a trial &amp; see the Judges in their big wigs – he was most amused at the greeting between a countryman of ours with them when he gratified their wish to go on board an American ship. the mate a Massachusetts man would scarcely let them go ashore again he and Jemie were so communicative, so truly “hail fellow well met”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-873-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-873">873</a></span></span> I availed of opportunity for hearing the greatest pulpit orator of Liverpool,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-874-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-874">874</a></span></span> altho M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Sandland does not frequent S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Judes. it is not distant from her house. Eliza went with me to the thursday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-875-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-875">875</a></span></span> lecture the very first evening of my arrival, I had heard the eloquence of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span> Neill (now Doctor extolled, &amp; perhaps it was because of such extravagent praise I was at first rather disappointed, his discourse was from the 6<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of Romans.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-876-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-876">876</a></span></span> it certainly was excellent, for Hugh M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span>Neill is a most clear reasoner. I went again on Sunday morning,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-877-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-877">877</a></span></span> the aisles were filled, but so many families being out of town there was not the usual difficulty of obtaining seats in pews &amp; we faced the reverend speaker, who wins each time more &amp; more upon his auditors. the whole service is most impressive. A lady member of the congregation—is the only female in the not numerous choir, her voice is very fine, simple tunes are selected as most easily joined in by the whole congregation. The illustrations given to his subject by M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span>Neill are very beautiful, he preaches without notes. referring from time to time to the little pocket bible which he has open in his hand. as tho he is most attentive to the <span class="CharOverride-1">written</span> word, which he seems to have by heart. In the evening he preached from 2<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span> Epistle of S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Peter.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-878-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-878">878</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>I was sorry not to have taken my Jemie to hear him, as he described the works which would be burnt up!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-879-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-879">879</a></span></span> even every thing however important in the estimation of man - which is not to the glory of God! Oh how rivetted was the attention of the hundreds who filled aisles &amp; pews &amp; galleries! may it not have been in vain! On monday I went to see my friends the Blis’s for the last time at the American boarding house in Duke S<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʊ</span> <span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-880-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-880">880</a></span></span> Sarah B took charge of a pot of Ivy plants for my Sister Kate, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Bliss promised to deliver a parcel to my dear mother from me. I cannot say I envied them embarking in the Montezuma<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-881-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-881">881</a></span></span> that day, tho the ship is so fine, so many emigrants were to be fellow passengers. these kind friends had told me much of their Swiss tour in a first call I made them in Liverpool, they described Debo as quite a heroine &amp; said she had been such an acquisition to their party.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-882-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-882">882</a></span></span> but they had been obliged to give her up to our friends in London, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Clarke Haden<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-883-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-883">883</a></span></span> claimed the fulfilment of our daughters promise to visit her in Deans Yard Westminster.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-884-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-884">884</a></span></span> And the Maingays at Woolwich<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-885-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-885">885</a></span></span> must have their share. So when I first took possession of a pretty cottage over at Egremont on the Cheshire coast<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-886-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-886">886</a></span></span> to give Jemie more sea bathing, Eliza Sandland only accompanied myself &amp; boys. Aunt Alicia &amp; our servant Mary soon after joined us from Preston. The weather was hot in Liverpool, we realized how preferable the opposite side of the river was whenever we were attracted to the city to shop, but the crossing in the ferry steamers we found very agreable with each its band of music. Eliza &amp; I sometimes exerted ourselves to rise early enough to take a stroll before breakfast, her dear mother occasionally would cross over from the city to spend a long afternoon with us, she enjoyed as much as we did the walks in which the environs of Egremont abound, &amp; while we three were enticed to wander thro pretty lanes &amp; corn fields, John Sandland would join my boys in their juvenile sports, reporting to me, when 7 oclock assembled us all around our frugal evening meal, that they had been boys together. I must not omit to record the friendly attentions of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Vallances<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-887-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-887">887</a></span></span> family to us, it was pleasant to me to meet an early friend in his sweet little wife,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-888-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-888">888</a></span></span> &amp; her brother George Dunscombe<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-889-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-889">889</a></span></span> being on a visit from my native land to his own, could tell me much of my own dear brothers family circle at New York. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Vallance has a numerous family circle of her own now, her eldest daughter Minnie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-890-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-890">890</a></span></span> a girl in her teens I took great interest in, because of her amiability &amp; self devotion to her mama &amp; the little ones. she spent an afternoon with us at the cottage M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Edw<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> Maude<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-891-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-891">891</a></span></span> also was very attentive to us. I had been introduced to him when he passed thro Preston, he supped &amp; slept at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winstanleys, &amp; is a favorite. his lodgings being near ours on the beach, he stopped sometimes to take my letters for Russia or America to the Liverpool post office, sometimes we met in crossing the ferry, &amp; once he made leisure to take my boys fishing, And when at last the day was at last the day was appointed for my dear Debos leaving London with Emma Maingay as her companion, he politely met them at the station in L Pool &amp; brought them to our cottage door. little Willies eagerness to see Sister was so great, he waited at the Egremont ferry &amp; capered by her side all the way, till Jemie at our gate claimed the turn of bringing her to Mother. How happy it made us to have Debo restored to us in safety after all her perils by sea &amp; land, but tho her countenance looked cheerful, to me she appeared not to have regained health in her tour thro Switzerland, she was very eager to recount to me in a tête à tête on the sofa after tea her pleasant visit to the kind Hadens at Deans Yard, &amp; as I had lost my voice by a severe cold (caught thro imprudently prolonging my enjoyment in bathing) hers sunk to a whisper, as she described to me each member of the family. I was not suspicious of any other cause than sympathy in my inability to speak above a whisper. &amp; therefore did not trace the many symptoms of her mind being ill at ease to the true cause in the day or two succeeding her joining us at the sea side. On thursday the 26<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> of August however all was explained satisfactorily by letters from 62 Sloan S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> from an unknown member of the Haden family,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-892-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-892">892</a></span></span> &amp; also vouchers from his Aunt in Deans Y<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƚ</span> never did I realize the friendship of dear Annie Ormerod so truly, I found she had acted as a tender mother to my daughter while under her protection, &amp; she wrote that the young physician her husbands nephew who had attended herself thro several illnesses, was soliciting her influence for our consent to his union with Debo. The brief period of their acquaintance we must overlook because of the long friendship between his family &amp; our own<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-893-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-893">893</a></span></span> - the surprise must be softened to Whistler &amp; I became at once an Amenuensis, in copying the letters which came daily from London, those from our old friend Annie O. now M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Clarke Haden of course being the best vouchers for all that others wrote in favor of the nephew of her husband.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-894-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-894">894</a></span></span> Dear Debo herself arose very early to write her fond father upon this most important event of her young life.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-895-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-895">895</a></span></span> And she chose also to acquaint her Aunt &amp; Uncle Winstanley, a day only elapsed ere she received their blessing, but we must yet wait long ere she can receive that of her father or know whether he can comply with our united wishes for his coming to England to meet us.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-896-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-896">896</a></span></span> Debos heart is so set upon the accomplishment of Seymours hopes for their union this autumn, her Aunt Eliza says we might as well chop her head off as propose her going back to Russia &amp; indeed she seems to depend upon daily communications to &amp; from Sloan S<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʊ</span> – for as the youthful pair had plighted their troth I could not oppose their very natural wish to write each other, tho a visit from the lover is deferred until we have the countenance of Whistler to give opriety to it. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hadens mother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-897-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-897">897</a></span></span> wrote Debo at once upon learning the state of his affections, of her entire approval. Mary Boott who is the affianced of his (only brother) Charles,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-898-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-898">898</a></span></span> has written in the most lively strain her delight that her dear little D is to be one among them. while Rose Haden<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-899-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-899">899</a></span></span> the young &amp; only sister of these fond brothers is only prevented by her timidity writing the favored one. Seymour has sent Debo a brief memoir in print, of his father,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-900-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-900">900</a></span></span> which tells us he also was a physician, a man of worth &amp; talents beyond the common lot, that he wrote many valuable treatises on medicine, &amp; was conspicuous as a member of a musical coterié, he died young. The great talent for music among all this family of Haden, might lead to the presumption of connection at least with the celebrated composer, but that the name is spelt differently.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-901-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-901">901</a></span></span> Our friend M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Kirk Boott,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-902-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-902">902</a></span></span> having always been particularly partial to Debo, will I think be well pleased that her favorite nephew Seymour is to bring the dear girl into their family circle. he no doubt has written to inform them in Boston. altho we have only to our own George disclosed his sisters prospects. until we have her fathers views as to the marriage. dear little Willie &amp; Jemie have not the least idea that their sweet “Sis” is seeking a home in England. when they know it, they will become better reconciled to remaining at Holly Bank,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-903-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-903">903</a></span></span> in the prospect of spending their holidays with her occasionally —— And now have months elapsed since my poor journal was opened,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-904-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-904">904</a></span></span> we did not doom our dear boys to a separation from us, for when their father joined us at Preston to give away their sister in marriage, he could not bear to part from all at once. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Stewart expressed his regret at their removal from his school in the most fattering terms, saying that their example would have been valuable to the other boys. indeed I had observed with grateful emotions that the blessing from on high, upon our training them, had enabled Jemie especially to resist temptations among his play fellows, that he had not yeilded to their persuasions to deceive their masters &amp; that when he had made mistakes, he still had courage to confess his fault. May God always continue to my darling James &amp; Willie tender consciences, that they may never prevaricate. It was with fervent prayer I sought counsel from God in our important decision as to whether to leave our boys in England, or to bring them back to Russia, for I knew their fond father would not without due consideration decide, as he would make any sacrifice of selfish inclination for their future good, especially for James health. We went to Holly Bank together the next day after Whistlers arrival at Preston (I have not described that, tho it was so exciting at the time, my spirits had been at the lowest ebb, when my Sisters went out hoping to bring me at least a letter, on their way to the office Sister Alicia discovered G W W in the large white familiar characters upon some trunks a porter was wheeling across from the rail road station,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-905-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-905">905</a></span></span> she sprung forward to embrace them, but happily fell upon Whistler, who became as eager as my sisters to reach home for the public exhibition of feeling made him shrink from public gaze! how welcome he was to us all! the transition from a most painful state of suspence &amp; anxiety, to joy was almost too great for me. and we thought him looking so well! &amp; he had not experienced any of the storms, which had made me tremble for his safety. Oh how delighted he was to have Debo beside him! he was rather shocked at finding the wedding day fixed, without waiting for him, it was monday he arrived &amp; thursday was to have been the day, he must be in London that day to deliver government despatches,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-906-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-906">906</a></span></span> so it was put off till Saturday)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-907-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-907">907</a></span></span> there was so much bustle in anticipation of winding up Debos affairs at Preston, that her father &amp; I were glad to find ourselves occupying a car of the 1<span class="CharOverride-9">st</span> class on our way to Liverpool. it was beautiful bright weather. the sail to Birkenhead was lovely &amp; Oh how delighted our boys were to welcome us at school. we did not then think they were to return to it <span class="CharOverride-1">only</span> to say farewell to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Stewart,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-908-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-908">908</a></span></span> who seemed so fond of them. we asked for them to visit Preston for some days. their carpet bag was soon put up, a new suit of clothes for each having been completed by order – Tom Clunie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-909-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-909">909</a></span></span> had taken them to the most fashionable tailor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-910-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-910">910</a></span></span> for a new Polka jacket<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-911-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-911">911</a></span></span> &amp; pr of white trowsers. tho I had not let the secret out that these were for bridal array– We lunched at a confectioners in Bold S<span class="CharOverride-9">t </span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-912-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-912">912</a></span></span> instead of dinner &amp; then put Willie in a Fly<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-913-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-913">913</a></span></span> with the carpet bag &amp;c to deposit at M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Sandlands &amp; wait our coming there. Jemie went shopping with father &amp; I, each of our boys seemed happy to be at our disposal <span class="CharOverride-1">any</span> way. I had to select a diamond pin for Seymour &amp; a bracelet for Emma<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-914-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-914">914</a></span></span> as bridal gifts from Debo. It was late in the afternoon when we reached 10 Cambridge S<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʈ</span> our kind friends there were so glad to see us! to welcome Whistler after five years separation,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-915-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-915">915</a></span></span> John really shone as master of the house, I was only sorry my husband could spend so brief a time with him, they went out to a stationers together, leaving us ladies to talk over the wedding, as we had not met since they had been informed of the sudden event in darling Debos life. they entered so kindly in our feelings &amp; mingled thankfulness at Debos bright prospects, &amp; our struggle in giving her up for life! they had attended to the wedding cake &amp;c for me in Liverpool. How touching such proofs of friendship as I gazed on their own deep mourning for their dear Bessie &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> John Grayson.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-916-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-916">916</a></span></span> Yes two had been taken in youth, from their family circle since I had last seen them, &amp; they had wept for the surviving mother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-917-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-917">917</a></span></span> &amp; the young widow &amp; two fatherless boys. John Sandland has sent me the obituary he had written upon his cousin J Gs death.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-918-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-918">918</a></span></span> We were obliged to leave our sincere &amp; affectionate friends directly after tea, to be in time at the station for the last train,. when we reached Preston there was our good Mary &amp; Betty<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-919-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-919">919</a></span></span> in waiting, who took all care of parcels &amp; boys off our hands, &amp; it was not many minutes ere<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-920-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-920">920</a></span></span> were welcomed in Uncle Winstanleys parlor. “What did you come for you good for nothing chaps?” “We thought you wanted to see us, as much as we did you” answered Jemie with the tone of a priviliged favorite. The next evening<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-921-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-921">921</a></span></span> Whistler started to travel all night to London taking Jemie with him for company. Debo had written Seymour at what hotel he would find her father the day he had appointed for their personal introduction to each other. &amp; at 11 oclock the young man was punctual, each had much business to finish in that day, thursday, for they were to journey back to Preston together at night, but Whistler managed to go to Sloane S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> to dinner supposing Seymours mother &amp; sister were there. so Jemie saw nothing to amuse him in that days visit to London, for father &amp; he were driving about from one place to another all day. The trio reached Preston at midnight, it had been as busy a day with us there, &amp; I was still in the girls room, where I had spent the whole evening helping Debo to look thro her treasures, to see what I must pack up &amp; what she would give away for I knew her father would not be willing to spare me from his side. I was the only one in the house who had not undressed. but not expecting our travellers till morning I was frightened by pebbles rattling against the windows of the girls room, supposing the only light had attracted a mob, for 20 factories having been shut up there were alas I knew discontented spirits enough, to raise a disturbance, &amp; gentlemen among the manufactorers having been late calling upon M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winstanley, I fancied were still in the parlor,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-922-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-922">922</a></span></span> I did not know how late it was really! &amp; the girls jumped out of bed frightened by the alarm I could not avoid shewing. I went down stairs alone, trembling, for the knocking was now at the side door. I opened the dining room very softly lest the gents should be there, all was darkness, then I went to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winstanleys sleeping chamber &amp; roused him, it was really a pity to disturb the good old gentleman, but it was a droll scene when he came out in his night cap &amp; slippers looking taller than ever in the long fur Caftan<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-923-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-923">923</a></span></span> my husband had brought him, with his spouse of lowly stature peeping out after him, for by this time Jemies ringing voice had brought me to the street door &amp; I let the travellers in, &amp; above stairs. the true cause of the midnight disturbance was understood, Debo had slipped a black silk dress &amp; visite<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-924-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-924">924</a></span></span> on and was waiting in the vestibule, to catch one embrace from her lover as he should pass up to his apartment, &amp; there was Aunt Alicia in her night dress busy lifting poor Willie from the bed Seymour must occupy, &amp; a pretty time she had with both the boys in hers the rest of that night! The next day there was no trace of any confusion soon after breakfast, for the nice Betty &amp; Hannah<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-925-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-925">925</a></span></span> soon ordered all the apartments &amp; Aunt Alicia chose one to herself in the attic. I dont like to recal that day to mind. for Whistler was not well, I staid in our room all day by his bedside. Debo was shut up in the little parlor with Seymour directing bridal cards to his hundred friends, to announce that M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Seymour Haden would be “at home” on the 15<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> of November at 62 Sloane S<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʈ</span>Ah what a pity that worldly ceremony made Debo forget her dear father that <span class="CharOverride-1">last day</span> she might have been with him, but she was so delighted with her bright prospects, she could not suspect that the approaching separation was making father ill. the <span class="CharOverride-1">business</span> of her wedding, was destroying all sentiment! Oh if we could have had it under our own roof we should not have had such a bustle. Yet dear, kind, Aunt Eliza took it all off our hands, &amp; was as busy as a bee all day in preparations for the bridal dejeuner. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span>Clarke Haden arrived from Fleetwood<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-926-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-926">926</a></span></span> in the evening, as it had been arranged by the Vicars<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-927-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-927">927</a></span></span> permission that he as Seymours Uncle should perform the ceremony. he had written a most beautiful letter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-928-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-928">928</a></span></span> previously to Whistlers arrival, over which we had all shed tears &amp; Aunt E would have me copy it for her to preserve with the last dear Annie had written her. Whistler made the exertion to get up for tea, that we might evince every respect towards the Rev<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> Uncle, but Oh it was painful the gloom which hung upon our spirits. Emma whispered me for mercys sake, to propose music, I did ask Seymour if I might have the pleasure of hearing him chaunt with the girls, but he thought his poor Uncle would associate it with the past &amp; be over come, so we had to try to talk, but every one seemed pre-occupied, &amp; the Vicar called upon M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> C Haden, &amp; Seymour was summoned to the dining room to see him too. I had put up a pr of white silk gloves for each the maid servants with a half sovereign slipped in the finger as Miss W-s parting gift after prayers, &amp; the coachman George his pair with a sovereign. My Sister selected the 12<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> Chap of Romans<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-929-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-929">929</a></span></span> which she read very impressively, previously having told us, that it had been a favorite of her Grandmothers.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-930-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-930">930</a></span></span> That night every thing had been ordered so that we should be like clock work, to lose not a moment of Debos wedding day. her trunks were already packed. The 16<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of Oct was one of the brightest days ever experienced in England. When I first met my Sisters they were all dressed in satins, &amp; ready to be bonnetted. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winstanley was seated in the little parlor where any one who wished coffee or tea buttered toast or dry or even an egg might go sans ceremonie &amp; take it. Before the bride &amp; only brides maid Emma put on their shubes to go to the carriage, the half dozen maid servants<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-931-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-931">931</a></span></span> begged to be admitted to their chamber to see &amp; admire them. I think there were three carriages to drive us to the old Parish church. I congratulated the young ladies their dresses were quite covered by the long black satin shubes. for unluckily it was market day &amp; Fishergate was thronged early as it was. As we encircled the altar in the nave of the old church, so gloriously shone the sun thro the eastern windows, that rainbow hues covered the Altar. we were only a family party – little Johnie Chapman<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-932-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-932">932</a></span></span> was the only spectator &amp; he told his mama<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-933-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-933">933</a></span></span> on his return home, he had been blinded by the tears, which would come as he thought Miss Whistler was going away from them forever! affectionate little fellow! The so lately-widow’d uncle read the service most impressively, but when he put his hand upon the head of the newly wedded pair to bless them, his words almost chocked him - no doubt thoughts of Annie rushed to his mind - but he recovered his self command for the rest of the day – I was annoyed by the rudeness of the crowd pressing upon us as we attempted to get from the church to the carriage, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winstanley expected it &amp; had filled our boys pockets &amp; his own with sixpences, but still he cried shame on the English custom<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-934-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-934">934</a></span></span> while the shower of silver diverted the rude people from us &amp; we soon drove home The Vicar only was invited to the bridal dejeûner, it certainly was ample &amp; elegant, on each side of the ornamented wedding cake were the beautiful bouquets which M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Chapman had sent to London for in the expectation that the bride &amp; Emma (the only brides maid – would have held them. but choice &amp; aromatic as were the flowers, they would have been inconvenient to carry, they graced the table, which had also a great display of the Winstanley plate; dear Debo was seated between her father &amp; Seymour, looking the happiest of the happy, not thinking of how soon she was to part from the gentle &amp; indulgent parent but full of fond anticipations of a bright future with the young protector her heart had selected. she wore her white chip bonnet<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-935-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-935">935</a></span></span> during breakfast &amp; Emma a pretty rose colored bonnet. When the health of the young pair was proposed in champagne, poor Whistler raised his eyes to the portrait of my brother William over the mantle peice opposite where they sat, &amp; said “let us next drink to the health of our brother, who would I am sure take a lively part in, what now engages us if he could be here”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-936-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-936">936</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>— The passing of wedding cake thro the pure gold ring Debo was then required to condescend to.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-937-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-937">937</a></span></span> soon after which I went with her to her room that she might change her white dress for a travelling one, which was equally becoming. While there M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Chapman &amp; her daughters<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-938-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-938">938</a></span></span> came to say adieu, as they wished <span class="CharOverride-1">me joy</span> it sunk like a knell upon my heart. When we went down stairs<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-939-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-939">939</a></span></span> the drawing-room our friends from the Cliff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-940-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-940">940</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>were there, &amp; Whistler &amp; I had to endure all their congratulations, well meant no doubt, but surely if any had reflected upon the sacrifice we had been required to make, the most delicate &amp; feeling attention to our feelings, had been silence. Debo bid us good bye without a tear, her eyes shone with happiness, &amp; surely a brighter sunshine in England never shone, than that of the 16<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of last Oct. Neither Whistler or I saw the old shoe thrown by Aunt Eliza after the carriage<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-941-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-941">941</a></span></span> as it whirled off from the front gate, tho I heard afterwards this omen of good luck was not omitted. We had proposed going to Fleetwood to visit the bereaved parents there. by the first train after we had parted from our darling girl, for our hearts could sympathise with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ormerod, but Aunt Eliza insisted we must eat the wedding dinner first, she went herself in her rich puce col<span class="CharOverride-9">d </span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-942-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-942">942</a></span></span> satin &amp; new white chip bonnet to exhibit herself to old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Walton<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-943-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-943">943</a></span></span> &amp; took James to shew him off to the invalid - as the only grooms-man - Willie who was dressed exactly like him went too &amp; took from me a large peice of wedding cake to the kind old lady. I was obliged to appear in black at dinner, as no time was allowed to change my dress after it, and I had worn mourning for my friend Annie from the day we heard of her death, until dear Debos wedding. busy memory had reminded me of the sad solemnities in our drawing-room at S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg on the 16<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of last Oct! &amp; I thought how very similar the effects to myself &amp; dear husband the two ceremonies,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-944-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-944">944</a></span></span> we were assured our loss of our angel baby was his happiness he had been taken to heavenly mansions &amp; thus secured from earthly viscissitudes &amp; sorrow. We had resigned Debo for this life also, tho for her happiness in a new home. &amp; our hearts were heavy with grief at the distant prospect of our meeting again, for our departure for the continent could not be delayed to welcome her in London, on her return from the bridal tour in Wales – The duty Clarke Haden had come to Preston having been fulfilled, he took his place in the car for Fleetwood with us, &amp; as we had one to ourselves, he was not restrained in uttering what was uppermost in his thoughts, he bent his head &amp; said in a low voice to me “Do you remember when we last met at this station you said to<span class="CharOverride-1"> her</span> how happy you thought her, travelling with her husband? now permit me congratulate yourself &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W<span class="CharOverride-9">m</span> Edward Ormerod<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-945-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-945">945</a></span></span> just then came (by the Manchester train) &amp; took a seat with us &amp; we were not much more than a half hour in reaching Fleetwood, where poor M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ormerod<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-946-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-946">946</a></span></span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Edw<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> <span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-947-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-947">947</a></span></span>was waiting at the station. It was distressing on first meeting dear Annies bereaved Mother,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-948-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-948">948</a></span></span> but she commanded her feelings wonderfully. she often sighed as tho her heart must be bursting &amp; once laying her hand upon it whispered “oh you know not what a weight is here! but she can never come to me! I shall go to her” Whistlers tears flowed as did mine, yet we felt it more congenial to our present feelings to be at the house of mourning,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-949-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-949">949</a></span></span> &amp; we staid until the last train, with our kind friends, who seemed to think the more of our visit, that it was a proof we could remember them on such a day. What a busy day was the next monday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-950-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-950">950</a></span></span> to us all! Emma was to go with us the next day to London, Whistler asked Aunt Alicia to go with him &amp; Jemie to Liverpool, &amp; the two last went to Holly Bank<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-951-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-951">951</a></span></span> to bid adieu to it. I had completed packing Debos trunks for London &amp; ours for the continent when they came back to Preston by tea time. Very early on tuesday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-952-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-952">952</a></span></span> Whistler bade adieu to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winstanley &amp; my kind sisters, that he might spend the day in examining different stations on the route, he arranged that we should follow by the early afternoon train &amp; meet him in Birmingham, as we did. Oh that dreadful last day in Preston, it is too sad to recal the bustle &amp; the parting! after five months finding a home under that hospitable roof, much as I longed to be settled in my own home, it was trying to bid adieu. &amp; it will be a grief to me till I see my dear Sisters again, that <span class="CharOverride-1">business</span> curtailed my intercourse with them that last day. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span>Winstanley presented us each with plaid scarfs, even to my boys for the voyage. We reached the Euston station at midnight. Emma staid at the hotel there<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-953-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-953">953</a></span></span> with us till after breakfast, when (as she naturally was impatient to get home after a six weeks absence) we hired a carriage, the boys &amp; I accompanied her to Shooters Hill,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-954-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-954">954</a></span></span> the weather was bright as Oct in my native land, &amp; we enjoyed our visit for the day to Wellesley House. we found all the family at home,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-955-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-955">955</a></span></span> but M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maingay who was in town on business. how glad they all were to have Emma back again &amp; they thought her looking so well! she was almost crazy with joy! laughing incessantly. Eliza had just returned from visiting her district of poor cottagers when we arrived, she was the picture of neatness &amp; composure, looking so placid &amp; with a heavenly expression on her mild, sweet face. Emma joked her sweet Sister upon a resemblance in her quaker attire to some plain good lady of their acquaintance, Eliza smiled &amp; so did their mother, who remarked she could not resemble a better woman. “No I dont wish to look like her mama!” why not? “No <span class="CharOverride-1">earthly</span> models mama” gently replied this follower of our Lord. Eliza entrusted to my care a good book for her friend Mary Touchkoff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-956-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-956">956</a></span></span> at S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P. this excellent book “The family of Bethany<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-957-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-957">957</a></span></span> was a solace to me in crossing the rough seas — she gave me also a Russian bible to bring home, to place upon the window of our vestibule where so frequently couriers are detained a half hour &amp; where I always keep a supply of Russian tracts. After I had said good bye to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Maingay she called me back to the sofa where a sprained foot detained her, to embrace me again. how much I should have enjoyed a few days in Elizas society. My boys had gone off to the nut trees with Fred after lunch. but little Lillie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-958-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-958">958</a></span></span> clung to her sisters. at last I could make them hear my summons back to London. Our hotel was the Waterloo, on the Thames.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-959-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-959">959</a></span></span> it might have been amusing to watch the boats passing our windows which looked out upon the river, but the weather was so fine &amp; we had many friends &amp; places to visit. Jemie would have lingered a day at Westminster Abbey,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-960-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-960">960</a></span></span> for he had taken out paper &amp; pencil to sketch monuments, but the Sexton at last hinted prayers would soon begin, &amp; we must come again. It was just as difficult for him to see enough of the Colliseum,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-961-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-961">961</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>the statuary, panorama of London &amp; the Cartoons in turn invited him to linger. I sent Mary with the boys to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Pauls<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-962-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-962">962</a></span></span> another day. but took them to call at M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> T Smiths, S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> James Park<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-963-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-963">963</a></span></span> - a lovely situation, such a treat to me to spend an evening with the lovely daughter of my old friend M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Stevenson! I made an engagement to go with Eliza to Clapham to see M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Shaws family<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-964-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-964">964</a></span></span> &amp; Oh how disappointed I was not to accomplish it, I had been <span class="CharOverride-1">at home </span>under the hospitable roof of Calcutta House<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-965-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-965">965</a></span></span> five weeks 18 years ago, as Anna M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span> with dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Stevenson when we first visited London, together &amp; in the two last visits I have made to London with my children, I have tried in vain to <span class="CharOverride-1">call even</span>! for the Shaws now reside at Clapham, hourleys run there, but it takes a morning to visit a friend. &amp; our time was so precious, we could only call at Doct Bootts<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-966-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-966">966</a></span></span> the last day. how much I had to do that day! I took Willie with me to Paternoster row,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-967-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-967">967</a></span></span> to select a book or two to <span class="CharOverride-1">leave</span> on Sisters toilette as a souvenir of her birth day. then drove to Sloane S<span class="CharOverride-9">t.</span> The house keeper<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-968-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-968">968</a></span></span> was very attentive &amp; shewed me all the apartments to be graced by her young mistress occupation. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hadens study on the first floor. above it the dining room – opposite to which the drawing room looks out on a small park, Cadogan Gardens.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-969-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-969">969</a></span></span> Above this salon is Debos boudoir, furnished with blue, its walls covered with Seymours sketches of Italy &amp; Switzerland<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-970-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-970">970</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>–opening into it is a most commodious bath &amp; dressing room. Above the dining room – looking out into the flower garden belonging to their house – is their bed room, with its new wardrobes &amp; every elegance for the lady fair. it seemed a pity not to see her smiling approval of all, but the sunny days of Oct it was of more importance to her to pass among the Welsh hills, breathing a pure &amp; healthful atmosphere, she would have enough of London, even tho her home so abounds in comforts &amp; elegancies. We left our hotel after a very late dinner in the evening, to sleep on board the Steamer for Hamburg,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-971-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-971">971</a></span></span> never shall I forget the impression made on my mind by the contrast between those two extreme points of the vast metropolis the west end &amp; the direction we took to reach the river, as we drove thro dark narrow streets of the city &amp; saw such squallid wretchedness, it did not do to think of the luxury of the favored few at the court end. it seemed to us all we were driving thro a district of pollution &amp; crime. And then the Thames boatmen! what a set swearing at each other, seizing our luggage &amp; hurrying us so savagely into their boats in the darkness of the evening I almost trembled, &amp; scarcely expected they would put us on board the Steamer without pilfering us of some of our articles of luggage, but Whistler did not dispute their unlawful demand for hire, as a lady did who went passenger in the steamer with us, by which she was put on board minus a whole peice of broad cloth<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-972-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-972">972</a></span></span> &amp;c for servants liveries, while she was only intent upon a <span class="CharOverride-1">fair</span> settlement one of the men must have slily slipped back into the wherry this very valuable bundle, for she did not discover her loss until after she had lost all sight of them. The ladies cabin was rather confined &amp; very crowded, so I felt thankful that I was not one of those compelled by sea-sickness to keep my narrow berth, so I each morning met my husband &amp; dear boys at breakfast time in the saloon, and if I had not as good a relish for the meal as Jemie &amp; Willie I had plenty of books to beguile time of tediousness, and it seemed to me such a favor to have the society of my husband, this being my first voyage of <span class="CharOverride-1">days</span> with him. I was so soothed too when thinking of having parted from Debo! by the perusal of “The family of Bethany,” but I have before mention its having been recommended to me by dear Eliza Maingay. Oh how delighted we all felt in landing at Hamburg on monday;<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-973-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-973">973</a></span></span> not having spent quite three days on board the Victoria. the scenery to the city from the mouth of the Elbe is rather flat, but we gazed at the shores with villages or country seats scattered along, with pleasurable emotions, no such annoyances as passports or custom house inspection of luggage on landing at one of the principal wharfs, our boys were soon making their knowledge of German useful, &amp; amusing themselves by putting questions to the people around us. we were soon very comfortably domiciled at Streights Hotel<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-974-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-974">974</a></span></span> in the beautiful new square, in the centre of which is an artificial lake on miniature scale, in which at night the lights are reflected &amp; thus the effect of the fine buildings, is heightened &amp; extended. The custom throughout Germany I believe is to take every meal but dinner in travelling — in the same room in which the traveller passes the night, but we asked &amp; obtained the favor to have our breakfast table set (and a nice repast too) in the salle à manger. there was one bright little German footman who devoted himself to us. &amp; even prevented gentlemen smoking in the saloon while we were there at breakfast. At dinner unless we hastened from the table d’hote immediately after dessert we must have been quite scented with segars, as they were handed regularly round to the Gents. German ladies seem to be reconciled to the custom, for we always left many ladies at table at the elbows of their cavaliers. We found Hamburg an excellent shopping place, such an abundant supply of french goods especially &amp; as no duties is upon them, cheaper there than any where out of France. I supplied myself with dresses for the remainder of my sojourn in Russia I hope! Whistler tried to tempt me to purchase a very elegant cloak just imported from Paris, it was drab cloth<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-975-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-975">975</a></span></span> lined &amp; trimmed with dark blue, very tempting! &amp; Jemie thought I ought not to mind giving five pounds English for it, as father wished me to look nice! but Uncle Winstanleys gift of a beautiful tartan scarf was enough I thought in addition to my plaid cloak &amp; other cloaks at home. Whistler supplied our boys with new shubes at Hamburg, for our voyage made it necessary they should be thoroughly guarded against cold. And a blustering time we had of in crossing the Baltic so late in the season of Oct, for it was the last boat to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P in which we embarked on Sat Oct 30<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9">. </span>While at Lubec we staid of course with our attentive host of the Stadt Hambourg, &amp; Jemie paid many a visit to his gallery of pictures.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-976-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-976">976</a></span></span> We only spent one night at that curious old town &amp; went in the same vehicle which we had hired at Hamburg, to take us, to Travemunde. We had a continuance of bright weather &amp; did not suffer from cold as we had feared we might. upon our reaching our steamer, we immediately deposited our luggage under care of the Steward, mine for the convenience of the voyage being arranged by the attentive German stewardess in my state room, she evinced great interest in me &amp; tho we could not talk together she often kissed my hand &amp; her countenance expressed that she still retained the tender sympathy for me, which the painful circumstances of my first acquaintance with her had elicited, when she was stewardess of the Alexandra!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-977-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-977">977</a></span></span> There proved to be only one lady passenger beside myself this time on board the Nicoli.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-978-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-978">978</a></span></span> so that there was no objection to Mary having the state room next my own, but the stewardess was ever so watchful to attend upon me that I did not tax Marys services, the boys were however glad she was well enough to be at the beck when they wanted her, there were few gentlemen passengers &amp; each had an entire stateroom except Jemie &amp; Willie who of course preferred occupying the same &amp; next their fathers. I always remained as late as possible with Whistler, for he had taken cold &amp; was really ill &amp; felt depressed. the <span class="CharOverride-1">gales</span> were all in our favor, but we had a taste of what we might have suffered had our course been in the other direction, for having run too rapidly before the wind, the Capt put about to prevent our reaching Cronstadt too early in the morning, &amp; even I felt sick from the roughness of the motion a few hours. We were all obliged to rise very early in the morning to prepare for custom house officers. How different my feelings now, to when I had encountered their scrutiny before; how comfortable Whistler protection had rendered me all this route! what a treat to have him to travel with. the officers were excedingly polite to him, as his passport announced him a courier from the embassy in London, they merely asked the number of articles of our luggage, ticketed each, so that when we reached the English quai at S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg, our things we all passed ashore without being required to go to the Custom house. I have omitted to mention that among the companions of our voyage were two, whom we associate with occasionally as visiters at our fire side. One is a Doctor Crawford<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-979-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-979">979</a></span></span> to whom I feel much indebted for his lending me his Church Records<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-980-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-980">980</a></span></span> to read as he receives them from London, thro favor to Prince of Oldenbourg in whose family he has an appointment,-as <span class="CharOverride-1">moral governer</span> to his son.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-981-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-981">981</a></span></span> the doctor is a decidedly religious man, so true a witness of our Saviour among men, he seeks the society of all christians whether of the church of England or Dissenters, his attendance at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ellerbys saturday evening prayer meetings missionary meetings &amp;c as constant as his coming to our church on the sabbath &amp; he is one of the few never absent from the Lords table. The other companion of our voyage who visits us still is a M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Konoring<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-982-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-982">982</a></span></span> a Pole, but of the Russian diplomatic corps. he has just returned from Brazil after a three years absence from this city, where his father resides.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-983-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-983">983</a></span></span> he is a perfect gentleman, quite young &amp; speaks English well. I discover that his mother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-984-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-984">984</a></span></span> was a dear friend to my favorite Miss Funk. &amp; that she was a truly pious lady. the son also seems thoughtful. How glad I was to see W<span class="CharOverride-9U">m</span> Maingay upon our first landing! &amp; it was so attentive in him running to bring our neighbours to welcome us &amp; so kind in M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes to make the exertion to meet us with her husband, they insisted upon our lunching &amp; dining at their house &amp; had M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Gellibrand &amp; Lizzie Ropes to meet us at tea.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-985-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-985">985</a></span></span> I could not have imagined it would be so delightful to return to our S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg home, but no place had seemed so comfortable &amp; none so commodious in all my travels. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Prince<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-986-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-986">986</a></span></span> had had it put in such beautiful order, &amp; it had been thoroughly painted, papered &amp;c during the summer, even the double windows were put in &amp; bright fires were burning in the grates, &amp; carpet down. I felt so grateful to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Prince for all the trouble he had been at in superintending preparations for our welcome home! Matvie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-987-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-987">987</a></span></span> looked neat as ever &amp; was very much gratified by my having brought him a new blue cloth round-a-bout<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-988-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-988">988</a></span></span> from Hamburgh, &amp; a pr of white gloves, such as had been distributed at M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hadens wedding. Our faithful little Cook came to take possession of the kitchen the very day of my return, &amp; she liked the blanket shawl<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-989-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-989">989</a></span></span> I brought her from England, she had kept herself out of place all summer, that she might serve us! Our faithful Laundress<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-990-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-990">990</a></span></span> too had reserved herself for me. she came back immediately to her old duties, I had a pretty English cap for her with bordering of net &amp; ribbons enough to trim three. And ere many days even our good cow<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-991-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-991">991</a></span></span> was restored to us in better condition than ever, from her pasturage at Alexandrofsky, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Eastwicks family had had her milk for the summer, for her keeping. Ere I could unpack our trunks even friends &amp; acquaintances thronged upon me, ah how often I thought of dear Debo who had always been ready to do the honors in the drawing room! sometimes two or three sets of ladies would call at one time, for instance as I was receiving the fashionable M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> F B. the equally stylish M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Slatta &amp; the lovely M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> M A came &amp; at the same time Mad Melnikoff &amp; daughter,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-992-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-992">992</a></span></span> I scarcely could answer all the questions about Debo &amp; our summers tours, especially as Mad M speaks french or Russ only. By very early rising &amp; late taking rest I managed to get my house hold duties in operation before the sabbath came. And in due time to report our safe arrival to all across the Baltic &amp; Atlantic.

M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Harrison seemed her good husbands chief source of interest &amp; anxiety, he feared her being fatigued at the banquet which we all partook of &amp; before it was ended, by a sign had an easy chair brought in that she might rest. As her health continued feeble she was not able to avail of invitations from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes to all the American circle to keep the Yankee thanksgiving on the last thursday of Nov at his house, neither could she be one among us at a magnificent dinner given up by M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ingersoll our Ambassador<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-998-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-998">998</a></span></span> immediately afterd but as change of scene, quiet, &amp; entirely relief from domestic cares, were advised by her physician I had the guest chamber of our lodgings made as comfortable &amp; cheerful as possible &amp; invited her to make me a visit, she brought her little Alicia to renew her claim upon her God-mother &amp; my good Mary occupying the next room to theirs took care of both. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>H at first could only reach the drawingroom sofa by great exertion, but her strength &amp; spirits daily improved &amp; ere she left us, she even rose to family-prayers &amp; breakfast.

Whistler &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> H arrived from A with the boys from the juvenile fête, bringing us fragments of good things, but little Alicia came not back to town. Aunty Maria kept her as a hostage, how surprised I was when my guests appeared at breakfast to hear they must return home to a Christmas dinner. But M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> H looked as bright as the sunny day &amp; I would not discourage her, by advising her to let Doct H<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1000-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1000">1000</a></span></span> govern her movements.

When next I went to see her, she whispered me she had begun the New Year by using it regularly in her family circle! And since then herself &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leland have become members of our holy communion! M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Eastwick had gone up with me to the altar when I had no longer a daughter by my side, &amp; now these two Sisters have joined us, how sacred becomes the bond in a foreign land, when those from a distant country become so united by love to the Lord Jesus! Oh may we be faithful witnesses for Him wherever His providence leads us! I was made member of a ladies committee (patronised by Lady Bloomfield of the committee patronised by Lady Bloomfield of the British Legation)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1002">1002</a></span></span> for visiting the newly established British school<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1003">1003</a></span></span> as chiefly connected with our congregation, tho as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gellibrand is one of its most generous supporters M<span class="CharOverride-9">r </span>&amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span>Ellerby of the chapel also are of the gentlemen &amp; ladies committees. I should rather have been made teacher in a sabbath school at our church, but Doct Law thinks religious instruction will be connected with other courses of instruction at the British school — April 25<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> 1</span>848 And now in resuming my much neglected journal,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1004">1004</a></span></span> to give my dear mother as true a statement as I can of what occupies me while absent from her – I will briefly remark upon the success which has <span class="CharOverride-1">not</span> <span class="CharOverride-1">yet</span> crowned extraordinary efforts, for establishing this greatly needed seminary for the neglected children of English mechanics, weavers &amp; all of that class in this city &amp; its environs. No expense has been spared by owners of mills such as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gellibrand, or M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Baird who owns an enormous iron foundry &amp;c, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Wood to prove himself a patron of the school besides unlimited pecuniary contribution, placed his own little boy as one of the boarders, having implicit trust in M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Smith (as an English clergyman, who were sent from England) to superintend the classes, assistant teachers for modern languages, governesses, house keeper, every necessary aid, to keep in order about forty children of both sexes. Doct &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Law incessant in their supervision &amp; the committees to attend monthly to inspect accounts &amp;c, no trouble, no earthly means spared! yet evils unforseen have arisen, a want of unity among the directors, so that now the girls department is closed until another teacher can arrive to take M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Smiths place, as she is found not capable.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1005">1005</a></span></span> I have timidly again hinted the propriety of connecting a sunday - school with our church, why should we not among the thousand who claim membership with us find teachers, when in M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ellerbys little congregation of two hundred, they have a regular attendance of forty sunday scholars. God would no doubt bless our efforts if we began by asking his aid! I am using my persuasion with the Americans at Alexandroffsky to open a Sunday school there this season, as the room in which M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ellerby<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1006">1006</a></span></span> preaches to them every Sunday afternoon would be ready for the school, &amp; that devoted pastor could open it with prayer after his service. he has attended a bible class there weekly all winter. We have no religious instruction but from our pulpit &amp; I fear youth is not so impressed by it as when it is personal, <span class="CharOverride-1">in a class.</span> May the Holy Spirit teach the shepherds of Christs flock everywhere. I often sigh for some other evidences of devotion in our congregation, than the “Passion week” strict attendence at prayers in Church. During Lent theatrical performances are prohibited by law in Russia, &amp; the Italian Opera is closed but morning concerts &amp; tableaux vivant supply the want, &amp; members of our church do not deny themselves these courtly substitues for the winters dissipation. I cannot be reconciled to these inconsistencies in those who call themselves followers of Christ. Do I lack charity? I hope not, for charity means love to God &amp; to all mankind in Christ Jesus. I have had the privilige of meeting occasionally these few weeks past a most devoted christian who has been the guest of our neighbours M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Merriellees, &amp; have listened to the detailed accounts of the state of religion in the south of Russia which M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Mellville<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1007">1007</a></span></span> narrated to us, with intense interest, he has lately set out on his long journey to return to Odessa, which town has been his headquarters these last twelve years, he is a scotchman, but has acquired sufficient knowledge of many languages to communicate freely with Germans, Poles, Tartars, Turks, Armenians &amp;c he seems most familiar with the jews &amp; gives most cheering reports of their willingness to read the New Testament, he has often seen it used in their school, has there heard the youth in classes reading it. but Mahometuns also are eager to possess themselves of the scriptures, &amp; to all the mingled population in all his journeyings for distribting the bible &amp; tracts, he <span class="CharOverride-1">gives</span> to those who are too poor to buy, tho he finds ready purchasers. he would trace his wanderings on the map, tell us where were the <span class="CharOverride-1">fire</span> worshippers &amp; linger over some points of the route to describe the wonders or the luxuriance of nature, where ignorance or superstition clouded the noblest work of God. he came to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P to replenish his stock of bibles &amp; tracts. God has given him favor in the sight of some who hold great priviliges under this goverment, &amp; their names are passports to gain him free access &amp; egress on his journey, were he <span class="CharOverride-1">called</span> a missionary he would be banished the country. God put it in his heart to come to this vast field of labour, he modestly asked protection as a stranger &amp; waited for God to open the path of duty in His service, &amp; it is marvelous the success which attends him, we will pray &amp; hope God will impel other evangelical christians to follow his example. he says he only wants help, for the field is ripe for an abundant harvest. I often wished that my dear mother could listen to this extraordinary traveller! &amp; thought too how much such christian friends as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Nichols or M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Lee would have been interested in his recitals, he was so ready to communicate, &amp; looked so sincere &amp; so benevolent. When he described to me the condition of English emigrants thro out the interior of Russia, I felt grieved for them that they had abandoned all the free institutions of their native land, for uncertain pecuniary benefit, their children speaking only Russ, reading in no language! When I told him of the luxuries which in a few months has crept into the British school here, tho founded upon the most economical system only last summer! A dancing class clandestinely begun on Ash Wednesday! &amp;c he sighed, &amp; said how earnestly he wished schools suited to the necessities of the English at the south might be founded in this metropolis &amp; in Moscow. he knows intimately the clergyman in Moscow<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1008">1008</a></span></span> who arrived there last summer only, yet who has already done so much to improve his flock. he has given up two rooms in the parsonage for a school, he visits his people in the most friendly manner &amp; prays often at their houses. his wife is also a fellow labourer with him in his congregation. It is cheering to hear of such a pastor of the protestant church any where on this continent, where temptations to lukewarmness &amp; worldly policy, induce most to be mere preachers, deceiving themselves, they throw stumbling blocks in the way, by their own inconsistencies. We are now brought to an era of the world to make men stop &amp; reflect, &amp; ask themselves in what they place their trust. As my old friend Henriet Hallback<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1009">1009</a></span></span> asks me in a letter I received last saturday from her at Frankfurt on the Maine “who would have dreamed three months ago of the revolutions which now prevail all over this continent. France a republic! Prussia with only a nominal king! the base policy of the crafty Metternich (1773–1859) no longer endurable &amp; he obliged to flee from Austria, as Louis Philippe (1773–1850) &amp; Guizot (1781–1874) from France. how many of Earths nobles seeking an asylum in England, the boasted soil of the free! yet Ireland is filled with British troops to quell rebellion there, &amp; at the great meeting of the Chartists in London lately (the 10<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> of this month)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1010">1010</a></span></span> there were many threatening remarks againsts the expences of the royal family, such as “what entitled the queen-dowager to receive <span class="CharOverride-1" lang="ar-SA">£</span>100.000 per ann, while the wives &amp; children of British subjects were starving?” May God so over-rule in the councils of Europe that a better state of society be ordered. As soon as the revolutions in the south and west reached the Emperors ears, he issued the following Ukase, which was read first in all the Greek churches on the sunday, with great effect by the priests, who made every heart throb with loyalty to their Sovereign. It was published in the journals the next day.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1011">1011</a></span></span></p>

It was a brilliant spectacle certainly, &amp; quite exceeds my powers of description. I had counted about sixty dames d’ honneur, as they graced the hall in velvet robes of every hue with long trains richly embroidered in gold, silver or beads, their head ornament in form of a crown sparkling with jewels from which hung veils at each side, tulle sleeves also large &amp; flowing from the mere shoulder strap of velvet.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1017">1017</a></span></span> these ladies attended by gentlemen of the court &amp; military in the most gorgeous uniform seemed in gay conversation from the murmur of voices, but we know from private confession how wearisome are these ceremonies, so pompous, so heartless. At last all hurried to their places, the ladies had enough to do to spread out their trains to the best advantage, when the Emperor, Empress &amp; all the Imperial family entered the hall from their apartments to pass thro to the Chapel. The young Princess of Altenbourg - having been confirmed the day preceding now bears the name of the Grand duchess Alexandra - she is tall with fair complexion &amp; well formed. her dress was tulle over white satin, with wreaths of pink roses en crépe, in regular stripes from the bodice to the train, those who saw it near (as Young Ingersoll who told me) said there were rows of pearls between the beautiful pink roses. she wore emeralds; I had wished to gain admittance to the gallery of the chapel to witness the imposing ceremony of the Betrothal, my friend Miss T–<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1018">1018</a></span></span> had used her influence, in vain it being appropriated to the children of the Imperial family.

The first saturday of this month<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1028">1028</a></span></span> my dear James was taken ill with one of his attacks of rheumatic fever, I watched him night &amp; day at first in the far back chamber, &amp; then removed him to my room on the quai, it being more quiet, his dear father delayed his trip to Moscow till Jemie was able to leave his bed &amp; sit up in an easy chair, when he decided to take Willie as his companion in the survey of his rail road,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1029">1029</a></span></span> the cholera having increased in Moscow he could only venture there for a few hours. at midnight on monday the 19<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of this month they bade us adieu the heat then was excessive, so that I wondered at Whistler providing either himself or Willie with warm suits for the journey, but even by the next evening a change had come over our atmosphere &amp; we had a succession of gusts, of rain &amp; hail, indeed snow had whitened the ground for hours on the islands. Then the cholera was announced in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg as numbering its hundreds of victims daily! the papers at the same time reporting that the pestilence was increasing in the interior. Our good doctor was obliged to embark for England for his own health<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1030">1030</a></span></span> during Whistlers absence from us, his going had long since been contemplated, that he should leave Jemie convalescing was some comfort to Doct Rogers &amp; as he had decided us to change the climate for him also, he expressed the hope that soon we should meet in London. Debilitated as I was by anxiety, &amp; loss of rest at night, it was no wonder I should have felt more than slightly indisposed, as many were complaining around me, then the tidings of deaths among acquaintances added to the depressing influence of the strange weather. I discovered even our good, sensible, cook<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1031">1031</a></span></span> who reads her bible &amp; fears God had imbibed the popular prejudice &amp; was attributing the cholera to <span class="CharOverride-1">poison</span>, which she said enemies (the Poles were having strewed among the vegetable shops, &amp; even in the river, she feared to buy rice or aught else from the green grocers,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1032">1032</a></span></span> where we had dealt for five years. I tried to lead her to a higher source, to put her trust in God, to follow our good doctors advice about diet, &amp; humbly to rely on the Ruler over all for a blessing, &amp; an answer to our prayers. Twice I wrote my dear husband, &amp; from his silence argued that he was hastening home, he &amp; dear Willie surprised us at midnight on the 28<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> I had just risen from my knees for my heart was too sad to let me rest, &amp; was wiping the tears away, when I heard them listening at the door of Jemies sick chamber afraid to disturb him. How happy I felt to go out, &amp; prepare their room for them, as Mary had long been asleep. Ivan<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1033">1033</a></span></span> soon got some water to boil in the Sumava &amp; they made a slight repast, after which I bathed Willie, who seemed to me fatter than ever, tho he had been terrified by rumours of cholera.</p>

James having already gained sufficient strength at sea was planning our visiting the church so celebrated for Thorswaldens statuary<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1035">1035</a></span></span> &amp; Willie was petitioning for a peep at Tivoli gardens,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1036">1036</a></span></span> while I had determined upon a drive to Fredricksbourg<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1037">1037</a></span></span> the capt put to shore in his long boat with his papers promising to come back for us directly, but he returned to make us feel like half crying, half laughing, as he described their taking his papers from his hands <span class="CharOverride-1">with the tongs</span> &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">smoking them</span>, ere they would open or read them. the doctors boat soon followed his &amp; alas it bore the green flag a signal for quarantine. Yet prisoners tho we have been since yesterday noon, we have all been in fine spirits, and have profited by the excellent market, the agent of our English steward having brought along side fresh bread, milk &amp; fish for breakfast, and our dessert delicious ripe strawberries &amp; cream, besides goose berry tart &amp; fine ripe cherries in abundance, not to mention fresh lamb. Our 4<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> of July we spent wretchedly enough with a strong head-wind, sending most to their berths. but today we have had a respite from our sorrows. we left Cronstadt last saturday evening, my dear husband went from S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P with us, as also M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Eastwick &amp; W<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ɵ</span> Merriellees accompanied him.

Our Ambassador &amp; his Son, an Italian Countess &amp; her companion going from the cholera to her estate in England. a Danish gentlemen whom we shall leave with regret at Copenhagen this evening he has been so polite. A french gentleman is very amusing to my boys &amp; he goes all the way to London; we have two English ladies, &amp; expect to take in another from C this evening.

			<p class="Body-Text">Saturday July 22<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span> This my darling Willies twelvth birth day I have spent entirely devoted to his pleasure I bathed with him in the beautiful summer sea &amp; poor Jemie was envious that he also could not for the doctors think the bracing air here as much as he can bear, we three had a sea-side ramble &amp; then returned to rest at our cottage until dinner-time, I plied the needle while my boys amused themselves Willie in making wax flowers &amp; Jemie in drawing. we spend every afternoon in rambling over the hills or thro shady lanes, &amp; now having just come in, they write their journals;<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1042-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1042">1042</a></span></span> would that my notes were not so far behind hand!

We also saw the Sarcophagus of Thorswalden,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1052-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1052">1052</a></span></span> in a small chapel at the side, flowers faded &amp; dried were strewed over it, &amp; our friend the Doctor - who had known &amp; loved the artist personally - seemed to feel it was holy ground he was upon. as did our enthusiastic Jemie.

The motion of our steamer still making me dizzy, I found it impossible to coax sleep; at last I was glad when four oclock struck to get up &amp; write my own dear Whistler,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1058-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1058">1058</a></span></span> I also wrote a note to my Sister Winstanley to announce my safe arrival in her adopted country.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1059-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1059">1059</a></span></span> When I looked out of my dressing room window into their pretty flower garden &amp; beyond it into Hyde Park<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1060-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1060">1060</a></span></span> I realized with gratitude to our Almighty Preserver that we were no longer tossing about upon the fathomless deep, in the confinement of a ships cabin. Our hospitable host had no idea how many hours I had been up when we at nine oclock exchanged the salutations of the morning, he had been so careful that we should not be disturbed! it was ten when a very nice &amp; substantial breakfast assembled us around the table, I was thankful to have an appetite, for my head was dizzy &amp; I anticipated illness such as hung over me long after my last years arrival from sea in England. but this year I have escaped it, thro the mercy of God, who “tempers the wind to the shorn lamb”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1061-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1061">1061</a></span></span> When I left M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Fairbank’s family to walk to Sloane S<span class="CharOverride-9">t </span>(not more than ten minutes walk from Albert Terrace) it was with a promise to his children<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1062-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1062">1062</a></span></span> soon to return with my boys to them, for I supposed Debo at a sea-side place, but only Mary went back that day &amp; it was to have our luggage brought to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hadens. Seymour himself met us at his door &amp; after heartily welcoming us, ran up stairs for our own darling Debo, who had returned from Ramsgate<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1063-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1063">1063</a></span></span> purposely to be at home on our arrival, they had been enquiring when the Camilla would be in, but it was a surprise at last, as we arrived in the night. I found my dear girl looking better than when she was a bride &amp; happy as she was then I am sure she is even happier now.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1064-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1064">1064</a></span></span> my own anxieties pressed less heavily upon my spirit under Seymours roof where all is so well ordered, he &amp; Debo truly are one, their tastes the same perfect harmony &amp; cheerfulness reigns. I only missed one comfort in their home, family worship. but as I know they each trace their Saviours love in all mercies, I trust they will have the wish put into their hearts to raise a family altar, &amp; that their servants may be servants of the living God.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1065-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1065">1065</a></span></span> dear Debos health may have prevented her rising regularly early &amp; his profession interfered with the assembling all together day by day. besides his brother Charles often was obliged to breakfast &amp; go down to the city<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1066-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1066">1066</a></span></span> ere we had left our rooms.

In the afternoon I went with my boys to Westminster Abbey, where I was pleased to observe the devotion of the crowd, we could could scarcely elbow our way up to the pews, and yet could find no seat a very polite young lady insisted upon Jemie sharing hers in turn, probably she discovered his being still on the invalid list. We listened to a discourse from Revelations, from a celebrated preacher,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1070-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1070">1070</a></span></span> it was quite opposed to the Second Advent of Christ,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1071-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1071">1071</a></span></span> which now so many lead their congregations to expect. As we walked home thro St James Park &amp; the beautiful squares surrounding Buckingham Palace<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1072-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1072">1072</a></span></span> we were struck with the quiet in comparison to the week day bustle. this is as it should be among a people professing to read their bibles; no doubt in the thoroughfares of <span class="CharOverride-1">the city</span> we should have been more disturbed. In the evening Debo proposed sacred music adding, “I know Mother would like it! &amp; she begged her “mama” to lead at the piano. they could not chaunt without “Uncle Clarke”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1073-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1073">1073</a></span></span> who was ill, but all the Hadens united their voices in sacred melodies, except Seymour who was obliged to visit his patients. I have omitted to record the day upon which Debo went with myself &amp; boys to see my old friend, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Shaw,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1074-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1074">1074</a></span></span> at Clapham. I lamented that it was <span class="CharOverride-1">too late</span> for me to see once more the venerable Grandmother of her children, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Wardrobe<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1075-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1075">1075</a></span></span> was on her death bed! but dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Shaw did not assume a distressed tone in telling me how soon she must lose her excellent mother, for she knows the aged saint has long been waiting a summons from her Lord to go to “the Old Mans home”. When I asked her, if her mother would remember me, to express my regrets at being <span class="CharOverride-1">too late to</span> pay my respects after eighteen years since we had parted, she answered “oh she would quite recollect you, but she is too far spent to make the exertion to welcome you as she would wish” dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Shaw retains the same cheerful, lady like, deportment I was charmed with when I was her guest at Chelsea eighteen summers past &amp; the same air of refinement in her home, only some luxuries have been added, by the industry of her young ladies she told me, elegant embroidered chairs &amp; other gifts from her pupils, &amp; more valuable than these because her mothers work a beautiful white lambs wool rug, which she says is displayed in summer, but carefully put away when dark days would soil it. When she proposed to my boys. that they should go out into the garden to have a feast of gooseberries &amp; they thanked her in their happiest expression, she could tell me how it delighted her to see them such little gentlemen, she said many gratifying things gratifying to a mothers partiality &amp; in questioning me about my number, said in her own sweet way “ah then these are the pet lambs!” I asked about her own, she has yet the <span class="CharOverride-1">number</span> I had caressd as <span class="CharOverride-1">little ones</span> at Calcutta House,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1076-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1076">1076</a></span></span> her three sons<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1077-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1077">1077</a></span></span> all abroad, one had married &amp; would soon be bringing his two motherless babes home to her arms. I was sorry not to see Kate &amp; Georgianna,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1078-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1078">1078</a></span></span> they had gone out for the day on a pic-nic. Debo invited them to dinner, but they wrote of an engagement. What an encouragement M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Shaws case is to all to do their duty in the state of life to which God has appointed them looking to Him for the reward. when I first knew her 18 years ago, she had lately been left a destitute widow of a West Indian physician<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1079-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1079">1079</a></span></span> who had from his practise in Marlow maintained her handsomely, but looking forward to long years had laid up nothing, she a fond wife, was almost in despair, her pious Mother example led her to cast her care upon God, not doubting, or wavering! &amp; fragile tho her constitution was she opened a preparatory school for boys, her brother in India<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1080-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1080">1080</a></span></span> had influence to get pupils there for her, &amp; her establishment was thus appropriately named Calcutta house, she has educated her own children &amp; given them every advantage, since her two daughters have been of an age to assist in the school, she removed to Clapham &amp; opened it for young ladies,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1081-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1081">1081</a></span></span> they have every refinement around them. But now it is high time I begin to describe the Isle of Wight<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1082-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1082">1082</a></span></span> of which too much cannot be said in praise, we had been four days at Madeira Cottage when I dated this last fragment<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1083-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1083">1083</a></span></span> of my poor attempt at jounalizing for my dear mother. Debo could not accompany us from Sloane S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span>, so I left Mary to attend her when she should be ready, myself &amp; boys had the inside of a commodious rail carriage to ourselves to Gosport,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1084-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1084">1084</a></span></span> where we embarked in a ferry steamer &amp; were soon at Ryde<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1085-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1085">1085</a></span></span> on the Island, I should have felt interested in the town even had it been made less attractive by nature than I found it, for Cousin Anne Clunie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1086-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1086">1086</a></span></span> had talked much to me of its scenes when she interested herself in getting my boys placed last summer in a clergymans family, it is a beautiful place from its many gardens, &amp; hedges, green is so refreshing to a town it is hilly too, its fine pier is the fashionable promenade, but were I a sojourner there I should delight more in the rural walks at the back of the town, &amp; its sea beach where my boys could pick up pretty shells. I hired a chaise peculiar to the Island with only curtains at the sides, it was a remarkably bright day so that we were glad not to shut out the view, every turn in our road which was quite undulating, brought variety &amp; beauty to our gaze. Willie did not forget Legh Richmonds descriptions of Brading as we were passing it &amp; wished to stop to look for the grave of the “little cottager Jane.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1087-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1087">1087</a></span></span> We looked at one lodging house at Sandown<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1088-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1088">1088</a></span></span> en passant, tho our driver assured me I should be better suited at Shanklin<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1089-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1089">1089</a></span></span> &amp; as Seymour had recommended our coming to this village, I resisted the fine open bay which is so attractive to sea bathers &amp; am well pleased I was led hither, for we have even greater sources of enjoyment in the country walks, corn fields, shady lanes &amp; flowers, Willie has copied many in wax (for dear Sis provided him with a stock in London, when Seymour gave Jemie a paint box) we have frequent showers in this hilly nook &amp; are glad of such resources in doors. there are two very commodious hotels (Daish’s the new, &amp; William’s the old)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1090-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1090">1090</a></span></span> two provision shops, two butchers stalls, two shoe makers, one baker &amp; a blacksmiths shop,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1091-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1091">1091</a></span></span> the two last have rival ponies to hire at 2/6 for two hours, and there are two donkies at 6 pence per hour. so we have all we want, but the most interesting object to Jemie is Shanklin <span class="CharOverride-1">Chine</span>, a wide chasm in the cliff where he would fain station himself to sketch the water fall, by the hour if I would let him expose himself to catching cold in so damp a shelter, pretty cottages peep out, thro shrubbery on its sides, winding paths are kept in nice order &amp; with steps at their turns enable one to ascend to the downs above the cliff, &amp; as all face the sea, seats there are for those who choose quietly to sit &amp; read.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1092-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1092">1092</a></span></span> “Tower Cottage” is at the head of the Chine,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1093-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1093">1093</a></span></span> the house itself is so enclosed we can only see its thatch covered with vines by intruding, for upon the gates leading to it we read “no thoroughfare.” yet I have ventured to the very door, for I never lose a chance to make the impression of the beautiful on my mind; In one of our afternoon strolls (Jemie always carrying his sketch book under his arm &amp; Willie the camp-stool in shape of a walking stick for our invalid to rest while seeking health &amp; recreation) we discovered the <span class="CharOverride-1">little</span> village church,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1094-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1094">1094</a></span></span> it is in so retired a corner rather out of the village in the direction of the road to Luccumbe,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1095-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1095">1095</a></span></span> Bon Church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1096-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1096">1096</a></span></span> &amp; Ventnor,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1097-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1097">1097</a></span></span> we meet stage coaches &amp; jaunting cars going to these places, but never any bustle or dust. a shower often overtakes us, &amp; then bright sunshine dries us ere we can take cold. What a healthy climate this is, never chilly yet never warm, myrtles grow to an astonishing height, fusias are very plentiful, often reaching the top of the thatch, so gaily ornamenting the cottage gardens, I am quite sure I have seen some here ten feet high! I have so wished for Kate to feast her eyes! in this very luxuriant soil if the inhabitants only had a pastor like Oberlin<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1098-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1098">1098</a></span></span> how abundant might be their harvest, &amp; we should not have to pay such an unreasonable price for gooseberries &amp;c, as we do, also for shrimps lobsters &amp; crabs, but the shell fish is remarkably fine, &amp; our house keeper M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Reid<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1099-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1099">1099</a></span></span> dresses crabs most temptingly. the country people bring us fresh Eggs, chickens, fresh culled vegetables &amp;c every day, so tho we pay dear for these (luxuries to us from Russia) we have the most wholesome nourishment for our money. We get excellent milk, set it for cream for coffee, yet it is rich enough not to appear like skim milk &amp; is our common beverage for dinner. Then, our pretty cottage faces the sea &amp; has quite an air of seclusion from its garden enclosure &amp; hawthorn hedge, yet it is only a step from the kitchen paling to Higgs the baker. or from Merwoods our grocers. One half of Madeira cottage when we came to it was occupied by a family consisting of parents &amp; three youths, but they kept themselves to their own apartments, &amp; vacated them yesterday without our having exchanged any civilities. in an hours time they were taken by a young couple, who brought an only little daughter with their servant maid,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1100-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1100">1100</a></span></span> we had a continuance of rainy weather so that the juvenile members amused themselves within, or they had surely introduced themselves &amp; brought us all together in the pretty flower garden which encloses our cottage in its front towards the sea. the Philipp’s &amp; ourselves had become quite social, after my boys advances by inviting little Anna Maria to play with them in our parlor, she walked with us to meet Debo, when we were led to expect her one afternoon. we had to walk back instead of returning in the travelling carriage, for Sister &amp; Mary did not arrive till the next day (And now I ought to have changed my date for they had<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1101-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1101">1101</a></span></span> here more than a week when dear Debo came,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1102-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1102">1102</a></span></span> I take up my journal when I have a leisure hour &amp; thus it is irregular) How the boys had longed for their loved Sisters coming! but she had been to Bath<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1103-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1103">1103</a></span></span> with her husband to visit some of his best friends &amp; then to refresh herself in her own sweet home after that long journey, but at last we had her to ourselves! she came laden with good things for the boys who had only wanted herself - a beautiful bow &amp; arrows from Seymour to Willie as a birth day gift, a block drawing book with paint box purposely for sketching out of doors for Jemie &amp; a loaf cake for both, besides many nice relishes for our cottage table. among other things the rennet in wine<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1104-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1104">1104</a></span></span> I had written for was not forgotten, &amp; we have had sweet curd every afternoon, milk is so excellent in this fine farming district.

Some of our S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg acquaintances having come to Shanklin for health, have attached their party to ours, right glad to find us here, that never to be forgotten afternoon, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Morgan &amp; her little Fanny<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1107-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1107">1107</a></span></span> came by invitation to pass at our cottage. I took the mama one of my favorite strolls, while Debo kindly acceeded to the wish of the boys &amp; two little girls to go with them to a beautiful large green field, where they carried her camp stool &amp; Crochet work that she might sit &amp; watch them shoot at a mark with Willies new bow &amp; arrow. As M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> M &amp; I returned after our delightful walk; we saw Debo &amp; little Anna Maria coming up the slope towards the village, we halted to meet them &amp; soon I became alarmed by their grave expression, they both burst into tears as I addressed them, &amp; Oh how shocked I was that Debo had been hit by the arrow so close to her eye I shuddered to perceive how narrow the escape from putting the eye out! little Anna Maria kept weeping &amp; saying “I did not mean to hurt M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Haden, indeed I did not but I could not manage the strong bow” But when we all assembled at tea, the eye having been bathed in tepid water &amp; a small plaister covered the wound, dear Debo had recovered her composure &amp; comforted the affectionate child, all had brought home appetites to enjoy the sweet curd, raspberries, brown or white bread &amp; butter, after which the two boys &amp; two little girls danced on the green till their bed time. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Morgans maid<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1108-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1108">1108</a></span></span> took Miss Fanny to the hotel, James &amp; Willie bade us good night &amp; then M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> M regaled Debo with S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span><span class="CharOverride-1" lang="ar-SA">&#160;</span>Petersburg anecdotes, describing M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Bairds<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1109-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1109">1109</a></span></span> fancy ball &amp; all such things which had engaged lovers of such false pleasures the past winter. What a contrast has that city presented this summer to the frivolities of the long winter, it has been desolated by the cholera, as many as could, fled to other towns but the pestilence has pursued them to all the towns on the frontiers of Russia, my dear husband never clouds his reports<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1110-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1110">1110</a></span></span> of his own health &amp; of the preservation of that of our faithful domestics with these fearful details, but M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Morgans reads to me hers, I am afraid to say how many hundred funerals a day M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1111-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1111">1111</a></span></span> records, as an illustration of the depressing effects of the pestilence which has caused every Russian to mourn the loss of some relative, the shops of the Gostinandvor were so deserted as to be closed, &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M writes scarcely an Ishvostic could be obtained to drive about the city, which generally is so thronged at every corner with these drivers of droshkey in summer &amp; sledge in winter, but all the peasantry fled from their occupations in the city, in number it is calculated one hundred &amp; forty thousand! most of whom perished from hunger &amp; thirst on their journey, for the people in the country shut up their wells from the superstitious belief that the water would be poisoned, &amp; tho so hospitably inclined as to share their brown bread &amp; salt or milk with every one who demands it, they barred their cabin doors &amp; steeled their hearts against those who came from the infected city. Since then we have heard of the cholera diminishing in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg but raging in the interior, in Moscow it has been far worse than it was last winter, <span class="CharOverride-1">it</span> <span class="CharOverride-1">began there</span>! We have felt interested in meeting several families here whom we did not visit in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P. Willie had heard Russ spoken in the village of Shanklin by some few individuals, with surprise, I advised him to chime in, it would be like music to the ears of strangers in a foreign land, so he charmed a nurse of the child of a Baroness<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1112-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1112">1112</a></span></span> one day, who entreated him to become a visiter at their cottage &amp; be a play fellow with the little girl, he occasionally went, the nurse who had picked up a little English, would get Willie to read tracts to her, &amp; explain the good stories in Russ to the little girl who knows only her native tongue. Willie was surprised &amp; pleased to see the bible in the nursery there.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">August 1<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span> Tuesday. At the two extreme points of the little village of Shanklin are the places of worship a very small church where the Arch Deacon<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1113-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1113">1113</a></span></span> who has lived half a century at the Parsonage, preaches once on the Lords day, alternately morning &amp; afternoon here, the other half he has service at another village, for he keeps no Curate, and thus a small dissenting Chapel<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1114-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1114">1114</a></span></span> has been built at the entrance of Shanklin, which of course is crowded when the church is closed, &amp; always so well attended that a subscription is being raised for enlarging it, a very zealous &amp; eloquent young minister comes from Brading to preach once on the sabbath, &amp; the other part of the day one of the deacons reads &amp; prays with the people. I went to the Sunday school last sunday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1115-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1115">1115</a></span></span> afternoon with M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Phillips, we were sorry we had not taken Willie &amp; Anna Maria who wished to accompany us – for M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Smith<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1116-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1116">1116</a></span></span> the minister addressed the children in a deeply impressive &amp; interesting manner. he preached in the evening Willie went with me, there was not a vacant seat in the Chapel, he preaches without notes from the bible open in his hand, which he seems to know by heart, &amp; prays from the abundance of the heart. The name of dissenter is merged in that of christian, when I meet with such an one as M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ơ</span>Smith, my mite shall be given, not to the new chapel projected, but for the purchase of a few books for their sunday school, such as “The Week”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1117-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1117">1117</a></span></span> suitable to this community, and under Gods blessings my selection of a few volumes, may be the foundation of a library for the Sunday school which the poor children seem to need to encourage them &amp; to make them delight in their study. I have gone several times to “The Parsonage” to see the myrtles<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1118-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1118">1118</a></span></span> which the guide books points out to the notice of the tourist as the finest in the Island, the Arch Deacon is evidently gratified to exhibit them to visiters, he came out himself to give us their history, they cover completely the south side of the parsonage, openings are cut thro them for the windows, &amp; they are cropped annually to prevent their getting above the thatch, he put aside the branches to shew us the thickness of the trunk, he told us they must be at least a century old, that he had lived at the parsonage fifty years &amp; they had always been as now during that time. What will the Lord say to this steward, that no trees of righteousness have sprung up,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1119-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1119">1119</a></span></span> no young plants now nurtured, no sunday school connected with this branch of His church! the parsonage seems to be all its occupant has really to boast of, it is a charming place, not only myrtles, but fusias rhododendrums, lauristinas are of an extraordinary size &amp; beauty there, and as a proof of the mildness of this climate, this shrubbery which flourishes only in the southern states of my native land, is never covered here. The old house keeper<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1120-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1120">1120</a></span></span> dressed in mourning &amp; fat as the Arch deacon himself came out to take up the tale when the church dignitary retired, commended the wisdom of her master in giving their home such an air of seclusion by the planting of a hedge of trees between it &amp; the village, especially now since Shanklin has become such a place of resort to sea bathers. We had in truth been induced to search for the parsonage by the guide book. I fear, not <span class="CharOverride-1">many weary &amp; heavy laden souls</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1121-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1121">1121</a></span></span> find it a place of refreshment!</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Wednesday [August] 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span> Yesterday the weather was so invitingly fine, the Phillips &amp; ourselves went to Bonchurch it was a pedestrian excursion, but we took two donkeys (slinging a prog basket on one) M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> P &amp; her little girl rode theirs by turns, Debo &amp; Jemie the other, for the distance there &amp; back was fully five mile, up hill all the road thither, I did not feel that I had blistered my feet till our return, for I was too much engrossed in admiration of the beautiful scenery, the pretty village of Bonchurch, has a finer church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1122-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1122">1122</a></span></span> than Shanklin, it probably gave name to it, &amp; may be the corner stone to it, for the elegant cottages all look new, these two places ought not to be compared, Shanklin is so green, such rural scenery, with its rich pasturage, corn fields &amp; fine trees &amp; hedges, the village built on the sloping sides of the green hills which enclose it, “country down to the sea beach”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1123-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1123">1123</a></span></span> Bonchurch<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1124-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1124">1124</a></span></span> has an equal air of quiet, but its position is bolder, the cottages are all facing the sea, but for bathers it must be fatiguing to climb the steep cliffs almost perpendicular, to their cottages which are on terraces of the cliffs, high flights of steeps are cut, we had wound our way by the coach road to the base of the cliff where there is a beautiful pond encircled by pretty walks &amp; shaded by trees, with swans swimming about it, &amp; pleasure boats on its sides as tho they at times were in requisition, the shops are opposite, few in number, but much more stylish than those of Shanklin. I stepped into a labourers cottage where I saw milk was sold, to buy some to moisten our bun &amp; to beg the loan of a few chairs, that we might rest by the pretty little lake. the children would fain have shared their cake with the graceful swans, but their long walk had made them so hungry! the milk was like cream &amp; the girls who brought &amp; took away the chairs when at last we set out upon our return, were so pretty &amp; so respectful! Debo went under the protection of the Donkey girl the same road we had entered the village, we mounted the flight of steps (I wish I had counted them it was such a height) thus we had a close inspection of the different style in the cottages &amp; their flower gardens, making such a beautiful contrast to the perpendicular cliffs which towered above them all, yeilding us a fine view of the sea which we could not see when we were by the side of the lake. Our road home being down hill most of the way, we easily reached it, to our three oclock dinner. I was rejoiced at the proof both Debo &amp; Jemie gave of not being fatigued, by their sallying forth before tea for a stroll, Willie is never tired except when confined to his lessons two hours in the morning when he sighs for freedom to range at pleasure. so they all went, &amp; I followed my inclination in writing dear father of their health &amp; happiness.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-1125-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-1125">1125</a></span></span></p>

At our family devotions my brother Winnie always was close to me that he might hear &amp; derive benefit &amp; comfort. his deafness having increased with his other bodily weaknesses. We would walk out between the showers. the beach being his favorite promenade – While shetering ourselves one day at the curiosity shop under the cliff, a most lovely looking &amp; young lady came in with her golden haired little boy - about three years of age, to purchase some toy for him.

			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-001"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001-backlink">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This entry is confusing. It probably should read: 12 March 1845 Ash Wednesday - Old Style February 28. See entry of Tuesday, March 25 (NS) in which Anna Whistler says that the next day it will be a fortnight since she took up her journal again, i.e., on 12 March. Thus “12 March 1845 Ash Wednesday” is New Style; the Old Style equivalent of March 12 would be February 28. The fact that Anna Whistler sometimes gave both Old and New Style dates for the same day suggests that she meant to put the date of 28 February after the words “Old Style,” but did not know what it was. Typically she did not go back to fill in a blank space.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">It is of importance that Anna Whistler creates further confusion by identifying this entry as Ash Wednesday, and it would seem that Rev. Dr. Law (see <a href="images_10.html#image253" target="_blank">Image 253</a>) is also responsible for her misconception in his choice of readings for the service on 28 February / 12 March. The Orthodox Church does not have such a day as Ash Wednesday; Lent starts on a Monday. Lent in 1845 had just begun for the Orthodox Church on Monday 26 February / 10 March, and Anna Whistler makes clear in the next several entries that it is the Easter season of the Orthodox Church that she is referring to. However, there are also entries in which she is referring to Easter celebrations in both faiths. Ash Wednesday, the start of Lent for the English Church, had taken place on 24 January / 5 February, before she resumed her journal, and Western Easter Sunday was going to take place shortly on 11/23 March. I wish to thank Richard Davies of the Leeds Russian Archive for discussing with me the Orthodox and non-Orthodox (specifically Anglican) Easter season of 1845, and the subsequent Easters of 1846, 1847, and 1848 that the Whistlers were in St. Petersburg.</p>

The progress of the book is mainly geographical; from Jerusalem the word spreads to Samaria …, the seacoast …, Damascus …, Antioch and Cyprus …, Asia Minor …, Europe …, and finally Rome itself” (<span class="CharOverride-1">New</span> <span class="CharOverride-1">Oxford Annotated Bible</span>, p.&#160;1319).</span></p>

Anna Whistler states in this entry for 28 February / 12 March that Rev. Dr. Law chose to read that morning the Gospel appointed for Ash Wednesday in the Episcopalian faith. The subsequent services in the English Church suggest that he tried to choose readings from the Episcopalian Easter service appropriate as well to the Orthodox Easter season.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">The chapter of Isaiah that Anna Whistler could not recall here was Chapter 58, which concerns the wrong and the right observance of fasting. Verse 6 specifically states of the right observance: “Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry …?” The “gospel appointed for Ash Wednesday” was Matthew 6, where right observance of fasting is also discussed. Verses 18-19 are specifically alluded to by Anna Whistler: “<span class="CharOverride-9">18</span>: That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly; <span class="CharOverride-9">19</span>: Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through, and steal.”</p>

His parents married in Hull in 1810. His siblings were Henry Raines Kruger (1813–1874) and Mary Ann Kruger (1815– 1832).

It has been housed here since 1830. It is the oldest institution of its type in St. Petersburg, founded on 1 March 1770 (OS) by the English merchant Francis Gardner, for the purpose of providing the educated class of the capital with a pleasant way of passing time socially. Its members number 350 and are selected by strict ballot. They are permitted to use the rooms of the Club from ten in the morning until one in the morning and spend their time in conversing, reading all the newspapers and magazines published or received in Russia, and playing cards (commercial), chess, billiards, or bowls. The bowling pavilion, set up in the garden, is of course the most elegant and agreeable of all its kind. Commons is held on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Saturday is primarily club day, when the largest number of members and their invited guests gather. On the remaining days, dinners are served, and suppers are served daily to order. Among the members are top state civil servants, both military and civilian, persons in the diplomatic corps, nobles, and merchants. The number of Englishmen, who in the beginning comprised the majority of its members, is at present very much diminished. The club’s accommodations are spacious and magnificent, the furnishings elegant, the staff excellent. Conduct in the English Club is relaxed, but respectful. Equality, coupled with respect for rank and for the dignity of a person, as well as superior and amiable conversation are the distinguishing features of this gathering. The Russian fabulist I.A.

There is a strong possibility that Mrs. De Glinkey is Iustina-Khristina Bangeman-Geigens, wife of the senior secretary of the Russian Legation in Stockholm, Dmitrii Grigorievich Glinka (29 July/10 August 1808 – 14/26 May 1883). They had a son and a daughter. The daughter, whom she brought with her to the Whistler home, would have been Iustina, born in 1836 (Polovtsov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Russkii biograficheskii slovar’</span>, vol. 5, pp. 273–274), the same year as Willie Whistler. The fact that Mrs. De Glinkey knew enough about America to be “so fond” of it, and that she also spoke English, support the idea that she was the wife of a diplomat. Anna Whistler and Mrs. De Glinkey had met before, possibly at Colonel Todd’s.</span></p>

Anna Whistler’s reference to him as the “eldest boy” suggests there was more than one son. She also often used “eldest” when “elder” was required.</span></p>

Anna Whistler would never have attempted to dupe anyone, especially a child, into eating such food during Lent, when it was prohibited by the Orthodox Church in the Russian diet.

John Wilson (Lauder, Scotland 11 December 1804 – near Mahableshwar, India 1 December 1875), whom she married in 1828. Mrs. Wilson was “a pioneer of female education in India and inspirer of the first Scottish association to employ female missionaries” (Nigel M. de S. Cameron, ed., <span class="CharOverride-1">Dictionary of Scottish Church History &amp; Theology</span> [Downers Grove, Illinois: Intervarsity Press, 1993], p.&#160;65). The memoirs of Mrs. Wilson that Anna Whistler is referring to are Rev. John Wilson’s biography of and tribute to his deceased wife, which includes extracts from her letters and journals: <span class="CharOverride-1">A Memoir of Mrs. Margaret Wilson, of the Scottish Mission, Bombay; including Extracts from Her Letters and Journals, </span>by the Rev.

Nisbet &amp; Co., 1838).<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>(The frontispiece is an engraving of Mrs. Wilson’s portrait made in 1827.) Anna Whistler’s attention was focused on the final chapter<span class="CharOverride-1">, </span>which deals with Mrs.Wilson’s last days. The lines she quotes are from the last letter Mrs. Wilson “wrote with her own hand” (Wilson,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Memoir of Margaret Wilson</span>, p.&#160;589). Written on 31 March 1835, twenty days before her death, it was addressed to a Mrs. Coghlan, at the christening of whose child she had been present the day before: “I should have regretted not being present when your little treasure was dedicated to God in Baptism. I always enjoy such seasons, and I feel them an additional inducement to remember both the little ones and their parents at the mercy-seat of our heavenly Father. They are gifts from His inexhaustible fountain of love and kindness to us; and we can only use the gift aright, when we present it a willing sacrifice on His alter” (Wilson, p.&#160;589). On 8 April 1835, Mrs. Wilson dictated a letter to her son Andrew, who had been sent to Scotland to live. This letter embodied her last wishes on her children’s behalf. “I have prayed God to inspire you with zeal to become a missionary to the brethren of this land … What I say to you I say to my beloved Johnny [a son in India] … If your aunts accompany your beloved uncle to Canada, I wish Mary Isabella [a daughter in India] to be placed under their charge; and O let them feel their deep responsibility in having her, a little immortal, to train for heaven” (Wilson, pp. 598–599). Anna Whistler’s tone in this entry resembles that of Mrs. Wilson. Anna Whistler was some four months pregnant at this time, and thoughts of her own possible death were frequently on her mind.</span></p>

It stands opposite Ritter’s house on the English Embankment, the Whistlers’ home. Built in 1764–1788, it is one of the first structures in Russia in the style of early Classicism. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, on the plot on which it stands were the houses of three magnates, which were donated to the Academy after its founding. These were later torn down to erect a new building planned by the architects A.F. Kokorinov (1726–1772) and J.B. Vallin de la Mothe (1729–1800). In 1788, the construction of the edifice was completed, but the façades and some rooms were unfinished. This construction was not completed until 1810. The building is in the form of a square, each side of which is sixty sazhens long. Above the four entrances are the words “<span class="CharOverride-1">Painting</span>,”<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>“<span class="CharOverride-1">Sculpture</span>,”<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>“<span class="CharOverride-1">Architecture</span>,”<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>and “<span class="CharOverride-1">Upbringing</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Vospitanie</span>)”<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>in bronze letters.

Between the columns supporting the pediment are statues of the Farnese Hercules and Flora. In May 1832, two massive sphinxes from Thebes purchased by the Russian government were brought to St. Petersburg, and in 1834 were placed facing one another on tall granite blocks flanking the granite steps of the landing in front of the Academy building (see <a href="images_7.html#image155" target="_blank">Image 155</a>). The building contains a circular courtyard. A spacious marble staircase leads to the upper floors, of which the first is decorated with arches. Within the building there is a small church built in 1837 and named for St. Catherine, with an altarpiece by F.A. Bruni of <span class="CharOverride-1">The Agony in the Garden</span> (1830). The building is decorated with works by the school’s academicians. On the first floor are the living quarters of Academy professors and various civil servants; on the second, the works of art; on the third, classrooms and pensioners’ (gold-medal students’) quarters. In the spacious salons of the second floor there is an extensive collection of paintings; portraits; landscapes; drawings; sculpture in plaster, marble, and bronze; statues; busts; bas reliefs; works in terra cotta; stones; medals; coins; architectural models; ancient weapons; and a rich collection of prints from Warsaw. Among the paintings noted in particular in an 1846 guide were Girardot’s <span class="CharOverride-1">St. Francis in the Cave</span>, Rembrandt’s <span class="CharOverride-1">The Angel Appearing to Hagar</span>, Veronese’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Resurrection of Lazarus</span>,<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>C.W.E.

The exhibits were open to the public on Sundays and holidays starting at noon.

A fuller account of James’s time at the IAFA can be found in his <a href="james.html">biography</a> in “The Whistlers as They Were in the 1840s.” There were three drawing courses at the Academy. They were divided into five levels: (1) “Drawing from Originals of Heads,” (2) “Drawing from Originals of Figures,” (3) “Drawing from Plaster Casts of Heads,” (4) “Drawing from Plaster Casts of Figures,” and (5) “Life Drawing.” The word “room” refers to the auditoriums in which the three drawing courses were held. The second room would then be the auditorium in which the courses in drawing from originals (1 and 2) were held. The two higher rooms would refer to the auditorium in which the courses in drawing from plaster casts (3 and 4) were held, and the one in which the course in life drawing (5) was held. This would make sense, because Anna Whistler says that the young officer who gave James drawing lessons was in the highest room, and the Academy records show that he was in drawing course 5, the final course (Kondakov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Iubileinyi spravochnik</span>, vol. 1, pp. 150, 184; RGIA Fond 789, op. 19, d. 735. <span class="CharOverride-1" lang="pl-PL">Spisok uchenikov Akademii koim vydany bilety dlia poseshcheniia klassov s pokazaniem poluchennykh imi na </span><span class="CharOverride-1" lang="ar-SA">èkzamenakh</span><span class="CharOverride-1" lang="pl-PL"> medalei. </span>S 1845 po 1849 g.

			<p class="Endnote-text2">Ewen Malcolm is the newborn son of James Malcolm, a private soldier in Wellington’s army, and Effie Gordon, his wife, who has accompanied her husband on the campaign. Spain and Portugal have been freed from Napoleon. Required to return to his regiment in January 1814, James Malcolm leaves his wife and child with Basque peasants, the Valsains. Ewen’s parents both die, and he is raised by the Valsains. Roman Catholics themselves, the Valsains, while making sure that Ewen is given instruction in the teachings of the Bible and goes to church on Sunday, never force him to embrace Catholicism, because his mother had a distaste for some of its forms. The hope of all three is that Ewen may one day be able to return to England. Ewen eventually becomes a guide to foreign travelers. He cannot understand or speak English, but the topics that interest him when he meets English travelers are the Duke of Wellington, returning to his own country, and “the religion of his country” (Tytler, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tales of Many Lands</span>, p.&#160;252). When the Valsains die, Ewen travels to the Valley of Luz, where he continues to work as a guide. There, he meets a party of English travelers, saves the life of one of them, Frederick Beauchamp (the hero of another of the tales in the above-mentioned volume), and is enabled to return to England, where he becomes a companion to Lord Beauchamp. It is a tale of nobility of character, love of the country of one’s forefathers, and faithfulness to their religion. No matter what their station in life, all the characters are highly moral persons. The locale of the story explains why James read a passage on Swiss scenery to Captain Kruger.</p>

Brown, Atkinson, and Co., shipowners, Hull, and was one of the captains of the Crimean war transports.” “He was connected with most of the philanthropic and benevolent institutions of Hull … [and] an elder brother of the Hull Trinity House.” “Though not actually wealthy, he rendered services to many local charities.” He died suddenly on the morning of Sunday, 10 June 1888, in St. Paul’s Church Mission-room, where he had gone “to take part in the church parade of the Hull Artillery Volunteers” (<span class="CharOverride-1">The York Herald</span>, June 11, 1888 and June 16, 1888; see also <span class="CharOverride-1">The Hull Eastern Morning News</span>, June 11, 1888 and June 14, 1888).</span></p>

[New York: Oxford University Press, 1962], vol. 1, p. 584). In all “diplomatic negotiation[s] between the United States and Great Britain since 1815,” the only point of agreement “was a temporary … joint occupation, north of latitude 42&#176;N, where Spanish California stopped, and south of latitude 54&#176;40&#180;N, where Russian Alaska ended. </span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">“John Jacob Astor’s trading post of Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River was sold to a Canadian fur trading company, which in 1821 amalgamated with the Hudson’s Bay Company that three years later constructed Fort Vancouver on the north bank of the lower Columbia” (p. 584). The heavy immigration to this area in 1843–1845, consisting of four to five thousand people, “strained the provisional territorial organization, and convinced Congress that something must be done to provide this remote colony with government, law and land titles” (p. 589). “Secretary Calhoun opened negotiations … in 1844 with the British minister at Washington … to divide the territory along latitude 49&#176;. But Aberdeen … refused to abandon the north bank of the Columbia” (p. 589). “A decline in the Columbia river fur trade was making Fort Vancouver unprofitable, and the menacing attitude of the latest American immigrants threatened its security” (p. 589). “The company abandoned Fort Vancouver to the Americans in 1845, and erected a new post at Victoria on Vancouver Island” (p. 590). By the time of this diary entry (5/17 April), President “James K. Polk, an expansionist” (see <a href="images_2.html#image50" target="_blank">Image 50</a>), had delivered his inaugural address (4 March 1845), in which he had “shouted defiance at Britain” (p. 590). This is the background to the possibility of war that concerned the British and American colonies in St. Petersburg.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">In December 1845, Polk “asserted that the American title to the whole of Oregon, up to lat. 54&#176;40&#180;, was ‘clear and unquestionable’, and asked Congress for authority to terminate the joint occupation agreement of 1818” (p. 590). But Polk’s “ambition was to annex California,” which would have meant “fighting England and Mexico at the same time” (p. 590). He therefore accepted Aberdeen’s formal proposal “to extend the international boundary along latitude 49&#176;N to Puget Sound, thence to the ocean through Juan de Fuca Strait, leaving Vancouver Island to Canada. He submitted the British offer to his cabinet on 6 June 1846 … and on 15 June the Oregon Treaty, describing the boundary according to Aberdeen’s offer, was ratified” (p. 590). The War with Mexico was by then some four weeks old. See “Maps.”</p>

			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-080"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-080-backlink">80</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna Whistler made little mention of the festivities of the Easter season of 1845. In that year, Western Palm Sunday occurred on 4/16 March and Western Easter Sunday on 11/23 March. Anna Whistler had taken up her pen again to begin writing Part II of her diaries on 28 February / 12 March, before Western Palm Sunday, but had devoted no lines to either Western Palm Sunday or Western Easter in her next entry of 25 March. In this entry of 7/19 April, she mentions only the Palm market preceding Russian Orthodox Palm Sunday (8/20 April) and the concerts given during the ensuing Passion Week, when the theaters and opera were closed. The Whistler family were attending the English Church (see <a href="images_6.html#image110" target="_blank">Images 110–111</a>) every day in celebration of important days following Western Easter. The English Church was marking the sixth Sunday after Easter, with Ascension Thursday to follow on 19 April / 1 May. Anna Whistler’s mention of the 8th and 9th days probably refers to the thirty-day cycle of readings in the Episcopal Psalter, which specifies the psalms to be read on each day of the month. The family went to church every day in the morning that week. On Day 8 in the morning, Psalms 38–40 were read; on Day 9 in the morning, Psalms 44–46. In parallel with the specified psalms, readings from the Old and New Testaments are also specified for each day in the cycle. Under Old Style, Sunday 8/20 April was Day 8 of a possible monthly cycle and Monday 9/21 April was Day 9. But Anna Whistler is suggesting that Day 8 was Monday 9/21 April and Day 9 Tuesday 10/22 April. I believe she made a mistake and should have written “Day 9” and “Day 10.” It was also the start of Orthodox Passion Week, culminating in Easter Sunday on 15/27 April, and Anna Whistler concentrates in this entry on the charity concert at the Assembly Hall of the Nobility that she, her husband, and Debo attended on Friday, 6/18 April.</span></p>

Since the end of 1839, it had been located in a building built for it on the corner of Novo-Mikhailovskaia Street and Mikhailovskii Square (or Italianskaia Street). The purpose in setting it up was to create a gathering place in which the participants could find pleasure in dances, permitted games, the reading of newspapers, and other pursuits appropriate to an educated society. Members were hereditary nobles from all over the Empire. Guests at balls and masquerades and visitors on ordinary days could be non-hereditary nobility, honorary citizens, famous artists, and Russian and foreign merchants. Males under 17 years of age and females under 16 were not permitted. There were two categories of membership: permanent members, who had access to the hall at any time; and visitor members, who had access only to the six balls or masquerades held annually. Permanent members each received two tickets to the balls for the ladies in their family. The number of permanent members was reckoned to be over six hundred. Persons belonging to the social groups named above and temporarily in St. Petersburg could be visitors on ordinary days, while nobles owning their own homes in the capital, in service here and already members of other assemblies and clubs could not. The latter needed to be members. Twelve visitors were permitted each day and could retain this privilege for no longer than six months. The Assembly Hall was open daily from nine in the morning until two in the morning. On the days when there was a ball or masquerade, the public could not enter earlier than one hour before the event. The Assembly Hall was closed the last three days before Easter. The balls, which in the 1840s had been combined with masquerades, constituted the main charm that the Assembly Hall of the Nobility held for the capital. The magnificent and spacious hall illuminated by crystal chandeliers offered many conveniences for these festive occasions. The hall was encircled by columns, behind which were raised galleries accessible by a few steps. From these galleries one could watch those dancing and make one’s way around the hall without crossing the dance floor. In front of the columns around the entire hall were three rows of red divans arranged like an amphitheater.

It consists of eight lectures, the first six of which start with the words “The sufferings of Christ as They Stand Connected …” Lecture 1 concludes “ … with the Character and Conduct of Mary, the Sister of Lazarus”; lecture 2, “ … with the Character and Conduct of Judas Iscariot”; lecture 3, “ … with the Character and Conduct of the Apostle Peter”; lecture 4, “ … with the Character and Conduct of Satan”; lecture 5, “ … with the Character, Government and Glory of God the Father”; lecture 6, “ … with Redemption, Faith, Salvation, and Condemnation among Men”; lecture 7, “The Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, a Subject of Type and Prophecy”; and lecture 8, “The Resurrection of Christ a Matter of Fact, and a Theme of Glad Tidings.” McNeile said in the Preface to the Third Edition that he was “maturely convinced of the great truth which pervades the following pages, viz., the reality of Christ’s human feelings; and of its incalculable importance to the devotional experience, the pure worship, and the consistent practice of the Christian Church.” Lecture 2, which Anna Whistler was reading to her half-sister, Alicia, proposes that in suffering disappointment in a friend we should consider that Jesus has gone before us in the experience with Judas Iscariot and take consolation from it. The interpretation given therein of Judas’s motives in the betrayal is very interesting (Hugh McNeile,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Lectures on the Sympathies, Sufferings, and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ</span>, 3rd ed., 8 vols.

Abbott (Boston: Crocker and Brewster, 1839. John Stevens Cabot Abbott (Brunswick, ME 19 September 1805 – Fair Haven, CT 17 June 1877) came from a family described as “represent[ing] the best and gentlest tradition of New England Puritanism.” He graduated in the Class of 1825 from Bowdoin College, where his classmates included Hawthorne and Longfellow. “Upon graduation, he served for a year as principal of the Academy in Amherst, Mass., and then for three years pursued a theological course at Andover Seminary, engaging also in the establishment of Sunday-schools along the southern shore of Cape Cod.” His first pastorate upon graduation from Andover Seminary in 1829 was in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he was ordained on 28 January 1830 and remained until 1834. He also held pastorates in Roxbury (1835–1841), and Nantucket (1841–1843) and has been described as having a “restless energy [that] unfitted him for long-continued service in one place.” This same restless energy is cited as the cause of “his type of pulpit oratory – strongly evangelistic, little philosophical, but well-supplied with historical illustrations and aiming chiefly at practical piety.” In 1833, he began his career as an author “with the publication of <span class="CharOverride-1">The Mother at Home, or the Principles of Maternal Duty Familiarly Illustrated</span>, a compilation of a series of lectures before the mothers’ association of his parish.” In 1843, several of his brothers “founded Abbott’s Institution,” a seminary for young ladies, in New York City. John S.C. Abbott joined them in December of that year, remaining involved in the school’s affairs for some “eight to ten years.” His book, <span class="CharOverride-1">The History of Napoleon Bonaparte</span>, appeared in 1855; although immensely popular, “it was also the most severely censured of his writings.” His hero-worship of Napoleon “antagonized many American editors and critics.” In 1861, he returned to active ministry as pastor for five years of the Howe Street Church in New Haven, Conn., but continued his historical writing and publication. His best-known works following his life of Napoleon were <span class="CharOverride-1">The Empire of Austria</span> (1859), <span class="CharOverride-1">The Empire of Russia</span> (1860), <span class="CharOverride-1">Italy</span> (1860), <span class="CharOverride-1">Civil War in America</span> (2 vols., 1863, 1866), <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Napoleon III</span> (1868), <span class="CharOverride-1">Romance of Spanish History</span> (1869), and <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Frederick the Great</span> (1871). He also was a prolific writer in “American history, biography, ethics, religion, popular science, and juvenile literature.”</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">“To the discerning among his contemporaries it was plain that he was a florid writer, overfond of moralizing, and lacking independent authority; but to a large public who cared more for picturesque narrative than for sober interpretation the books were of absorbing interest, and undoubtedly did much to popularize the reading of history” (<span class="CharOverride-1">Dictionary of American Biography</span>, s.v. “Abbott, John Stevens Cabot”).</p>

The popularity of the book resulted in a second edition, also anonymous, with the title <span class="CharOverride-1">Letters from the Shores of the Baltic</span> (1842). She wrote the letters to her mother, Anne (Palgrave) Rigby (1777–1872), during a trip undertaken in October 1838 to Reval, Estonia, to visit two sisters. She also spent some time in St. Petersburg and recorded her stay there as well in the letters. The reference to the Russian baptismal ceremony is on p.&#160;54 of the first volume.</span></p>

They left London on 7 May 1844, traveling via Hamburg, Lübeck, and Travemünde, and arrived on 17 May at St. Petersburg, where they spent a fortnight. On 21 May, they dined at Rev. Law’s. He “spoke most kindly of my book,” she recorded in her journal.

A factory named “Moscow Silk” was opened in 1820 on the bank of the Moscow River in the former Savvinskaia patriarchal district by the Moscow merchant, Rodion Dmitrievich Vostriakov, who owned it for 35 years. It came to occupy a prominent position among textile and trimmings factories in Moscow. The Moscow Silk Factory produced calico, which is a printed cotton fabric (“<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moscow_shelk&oldid=111765176" target="_blank">Moscow silk</a>,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Wikipedia</span>, acccessed 10 March 2023).

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">This time the Neva has dealt mercilessly with us inhabitants of Vasilievskii Island: for more than 24 hours there was no communication between the two banks of the river. The Isaac Bridge was drawn back on Sunday morning. Finally today the ice opposite the Fortress moved. At 11 A.M. the Commandant of the Peter and Paul Fortress crossed the Neva to the accompaniment of cannon fire and with the usual ceremony, and traffic back and forth began. Mr. Baird’s Steamship “Star” made its first spring trip of the year up the river but was soon forced to return because it encountered much ice. After that, due to a strong wind an enormous amount of ice appeared that drew with it a large number of barques and rafts and a large galiote. During the night the ice ripped away the boats forming the bridge that were closest to Vasilievskii Island and which are never drawn aside and carried them down, from what we have heard, to the Maslianyi Depot. None of this, by the way, is astonishing because there have as yet been no warm days or warm rains and thus the ice has melted only slightly. It is difficult to say for certain just when the Neva did open up this year; but apparently one has to say it was from today because yesterday it had freed itself from ice only in places. This is an extremely late opening of navigation: in 127 years, the Neva has opened up later than 23 April [5 May NS] only 17 times.” (<span class="CharOverride-1">Sanktpeterburgskie vedomosti</span> 90, Wednesday, April 25 [May 7 NS], 1845, p.&#160;404)</p>

Nothing can be more majestic than the exterior of this complex, which consists of magnificent buildings in the English style located on the bank of the Neva on a most pleasant site. The surroundings are picturesque and the manufactory in the midst of them is like a small English manufacturing town. On this site previously stood the dacha of Prince A.A. Viazemskii, procurator general in the reign of Catherine the Great. The manufactory was established in 1798 and from 1799 through the end of 1828 was under the patronage of Empress Maria Fyodorovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image415" target="_blank">Images 415–416</a>), mother of Nicholas I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>). By means of this institution, the empress gave asylum and ensured the future of several thousand orphans from the St. Petersburg Foundling Home, who worked here at cotton spinning, linen spinning, and weaving. Here, too, were made all of Russia’s playing cards, an enterprise bringing enormous annual profits to the manufactory, thus enabling it to be the gigantic establishment that it was. The main entrance of the manufactory is along the extensive porch of its church, the façade of which is simple but majestic, with an azure cupola sprinkled with stars, and consists of a single arch crowned by a pediment. In the center of the arch is a door and above a semicircular window, in the depression of which are two angels supporting a cross. On the sides of the arch are two niches containing sculptures. The church, named for Alexander Nevsky, is located on the upper floor of the building; under it is a huge hall in which the children gather before dinner and spend their free time on winter evenings and in bad weather. In the semicircular end of the building there is a drafting room, while in the vaults underneath it food supplies are kept. In the drafting room there is an excellent collection of plans for all the buildings and machines of the manufactory. There is also a drawing class here for children demonstrating a talent along these lines. Space in the infirmary, the workshops, schoolrooms, and living areas has been calculated taking into consideration a healthful proportion of cubic feet of air per person; i.e. the attempt has been made to eliminate overcrowding. In two or three buildings attached to the church structure there are: on the right side the dining room, bakery, kitchen, etc; on the left, classrooms, a hall for examinations, a library, and several beautifully decorated rooms for receiving visiting members of the Imperial family. The dining room is an enormous hall divided down its entire fifty-sazhen length into two halves for boys and girls, up to two thousand of whom dine at one sitting. In each half there are two rows of tables. On the wall in a special frame is a dining timetable for the week. Excellent students are rewarded with something extra at the meal, while poor students are deprived of something. The kitchen and bakery, which are on the lower floor, are set up in excellent fashion and maintained with exemplary cleanliness. Food is sent up in cauldrons to the dining room by means of a machine. At the table children are served by invalid soldiers. The food is considered very good despite the multitudes of children and various other workers. The children are clean and nicely dressed in their identical uniforms. They stand in a decorous and reverent manner and sing a prayer before their meal. In addition to their work the children study catechism, Russian, arithmetic, drawing, and drafting. The civil servants and inspectors were themselves inmates of this establishment when children, but have completed their period of servitude. Together with other workers and guards, they number up to three thousand persons. The total number of male and female inhabitants at the manufactory is about five thousand. In the middle of the courtyard is a five-story building (not including storage vaults) embellished with a belvedere. From it there is an extensive view of the picturesque surrounding countryside. Here there are well-situated, high, light, clean, healthy sleeping quarters for almost a thousand children. For the sake of absolute neatness, when they come across the courtyard from the workshops they must leave their footwear in one of the rooms on the lower floor and put on special shoes, which are kept in cupboards here. Water for washing is brought to all floors by means of pumps. On the south and north sides of the courtyard are buildings for cotton spinning. The first building, called the primary spinning mill, has a structure attached to it containing on the top floor machines for such processes as preparing combing cards and making loom reeds. The two middle floors contain a great number of lathes, boring mills, and other machine tools and equipment for making machines. On the storage vault level is the equipment for finishing skins used to make playing cards. In the spinning mill the cotton is cleaned, combed, taken up, and spun by machines situated in large spacious rooms. The workers, who for the most part are children (of both sexes), simply keep track of the proper working of the machines and transfer material from one place to another. Everything else works by steam. This structure has a four-story wing, part of which is occupied by various machine tools for preparing and assembling spinning and other machines. The other parts of the wing contain everything having to do with the making of playing cards. From 110,000 to 130,000 decks of cards are made here annually. Opposite this wing, inside the courtyard, there is a sixteen-hearth smithy made of inflammable materials and a small brass foundry. Lastly, there is also in the main courtyard the linen-spinning mill, located in a particularly spacious building. Here, in addition to a multitude of preparatory and spinning machines for linen and hemp, there are hand looms for sailcloth, machine looms, and machines for weaving processes like doubling and winding thread, winding spools, and preparing warps. In addition, there are one hundred more hand looms for weaving sailcloth in a special wooden structure. There is also a separate stone building, in which part of the readymade goods is stored. It too holds several looms. In a similar separate building there is a shop in which the workers deal solely with boiling and dying wool and which contains a spacious drying room. There is a special place for repair of machines. Near the gates of the manufactory is a building with apparatus for obtaining gas from coal, which is then distributed by pipes to the cotton- and linen-spinning mills and other parts of this colossal works. There are many fine little houses here for the civil servants, master workers, married orphans and workmen. There is a large school for boys and girls, where the children of married orphans and workmen are taught by means of the Lancaster system. All learn reading, writing and arithmetic, and the girls receive, in addition, lessons in needlework. Architecturally, the school is remarkable in that the windows are located higher than a person is tall so that the pupils will not be distracted, while the floors slope so that the back desks are higher than the front ones. Although machines do the work, those who watch them are each assigned a slate on which the previous day’s production is recorded and compared from day to day. Orphans of both sexes who receive their keep and clothing from the state have this deducted from their monthly salary. A part of their earnings is given to them while the rest is kept for them and earns interest. According to Burianov, there are instances when an orphan who has worked off the required number of years leaves the manufactory with a nestegg of up to a thousand rubles (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi po S. Peterburgu</span>, pt. 3, pp. 223–234). Pushkarev said that up to two million decks of cards were made annually, which is probably closer to the truth (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, p.&#160;609; Antonov and Kobak, <span class="CharOverride-1">Sviatyni Sankt-Peterburga</span>, vol. 3, pp. 228).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The director of the Aleksandrovskaia Manufactory (retired 1856) was Engineer-General Alexander Wilson (1776–1866; see <a href="images_9.html#image241" target="_blank">Image 241</a>). He had come to Russia at around the age of eight, when his father, James, an Edinburgh smith, responded to an 1784 recruitment call from the architect Charles Cameron, who was working for Catherine the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image414" target="_blank">Image 414</a>). In 1803, having worked his way up, Alexander Wilson became assistant director at the manufactory and, at the death of its director, Charles Gascoigne, in 1806, took over as head. Under him the manufactory became a tourist stop for foreign travelers, a number of whom corroborated Burianov’s statements about the exemplary working conditions of the children. The engineer Sir John Rennie said: </p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">He possessed a calm even temper, firm, but just, and conciliating, a competent knowledge of what he undertook to perform, without possessing any considerable amount of invention … [he] was thoroughly liked and respected, from the humblest workman under his orders up to the Emperor who was very fond of him. Lastly, he was thoroughly honest, a rare thing in Russia in these days, where peculation was rife from the highest to the lowest; and if Wilson had followed the universal example, which he might have done with impunity, he would have made a large fortune, but after many years’ service he died comparatively poor. (quoted in Bowles, “From the Banks of the Neva,” pp. 68–69)</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text-after-quote">Therefore, during his term as director perhaps the orphans’ nestegg of up to a thousand rubles was indeed possible. </p>

It is tempting to conjecture whether or not she was aware of its phallic significance. The point of her remarks here, however, seems to be that the silent, joyless masses in public spaces in St. Petersburg left a strong negative impression on her, as they did on most visitors, and that she felt that the masses would never be able to yield to the joyousness of Maypole dancing if it were a part of the Ekateringof festivities, which had to do with matchmaking. She herself would have been willing to watch Maypole dancing there, despite the joyless atmosphere she anticipated would be exuded by the surrounding crowd. Her remarks suggest that she herself had happily experienced Maypole dancing somewhere, and had evidence, perhaps from her English friends, of a more joyous May festival in “the south of Russia.” For information about May Day festivities, see Dorothy Spicer, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Book of Festivals</span> (New York: Women’s Press, 1937), pp. 17–18, 58, 88–89.</span></p>

In Russia, they favored knucklebones made from the joints of cows’ feet, because they are bigger and can hit their mark from a greater distance. Each player has a “shooter,” his biggest and heaviest knucklebone, often filled with lead or tin, and three to ten additional bones. A line is made in the center of an outdoor playing area, usually 30–40 meters in size for young players. The agreed-upon number of bones from each player is placed along the line in one or two rows or in a cluster, less often in a fanciful shape (e.g., a fish with open mouth) or by throwing the bones and letting them lie as they fall. There are various ways to determine who will go first: it can be by lot or by an elimination game, but usually it is by throwing one’s “shooter.” There are also variations on how one throws the “shooter” and from where. The first player goes up to where his “shooter” is lying and throws it from that spot at the bones standing on the line. If he knocks over a bone, he takes it. Each player then takes his turn. The game is over when there are no more bones on the line, but if any still remain after everyone has had his turn, the players can decide to keep playing with those bones or to each put down an additional agreed-upon number of bones. The game is usually repeated many times. The player who gets the most bones wins (L.V. Byleeva and V.M.

The young Scotsman who lent the book to her may have been William Saunders, William Miller’s nephew, whom she knew.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Rev. Robert Murray McCheyne (Edinburgh 21 May 1813 – Dundee 25 March 1843) was educated at High School and the University of Edinburgh, which he entered in November 1827 (Andrew A. Bonar, <span class="CharOverride-1">Memoir and Remains of the Rev. Robert Murray McCheyne, Minister of St. Peter’s Church, Dundee</span>, centenary [of his birth] ed. [Edinburgh and London: Oliphant, Anderson &amp; Ferrier, 1913], pp. 4, 5; all quotations in the following paragraph are from this edition). He studied modern languages, drew well, sang beautifully, wrote poetry, and had “considerable knowledge of music” (p. 5) In the winter of 1831, he began his divinity studies (pp. 5–6). Before entering divinity school, he had studied Hebrew and “could consult the Hebrew original of the Old Testament with as much ease as most of our ministers are able to consult the Greek of the New” (p. 29). Study of Bible criticism with a group of friends starting in their first year made him “indebted to this society for much of that discipline of mind on Jewish literature and Scripture geography which was found to be so useful in the Mission of Inquiry to the Jews in after days” (p. 30). Even before being ordained, he was sought out by several ministers as an assistant and in 1835 went to work with the Rev. John Bonar near Stirling. On 1 July 1835, he was “licensed … to preach the Gospel” (p. 32). The people of the parish, colliers and workers in the Carron Ironworks, were not religious, and his experiences with them made him sympathic to the Church Extension Scheme (p. 36), which “had in view as its genuine, sincere endeavour, to bring to overgrown parishes the advantage of a faithful minister, placed over such a number of souls as he could really visit” (p. 69). It is at this time that the first signs of consumption appeared in him (p. 37). In August 1836, he was chosen as pastor of St. Peter’s, Dundee (p. 50) and was ordained on 24 November of that year (p. 53). St. Peter’s parish was “large and very destitute,” and its “Church was built in connection with the Church Extension Scheme” (p. 54). “He sought to encourage Sabbath schools in all the districts of his parish” (p. 55). “His Sabbath day’s services … brought multitudes together, and were soon felt throughout the town” (p. 63). His voice was remarkably clear” (p. 63). He wanted to be “understood by the most illiterate in his audience” (p. 63). The communion Sabbaths, but also the common Sabbaths, drew many, who “began to journey long distances to attend St. Peters’” (p. 66). “The flocking of souls to his ministry” resulted in his being “solicited to remove” to Skirling, a small parish, and to “a country sphere” near Perth, for his health’s sake, but he chose not to (p. 68). At the end of 1838, he experienced violent heart palpitations (p. 84). Advised to stop “his public work,” he went home to Edinburgh (p. 84). In April 1839, he went, with his doctors’ approval, on a Mission of Inquiry to Israel with three other Scottish ministers (p. 89), returning to England in November 1839 (p. 113). Their journey is recorded in Andrew A. Bonar and Robert Murray McCheyne,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Narrative of a Mission of Inquiry to the Jews from the Church of Scotland in 1839</span> (Edinburgh: William Whyte, 1842) (p. 142). Returning to Dundee, he was overwhelmed by the reception given him by the crowd attending his church (pp. 115, 116). “In the beginning of [1843] he published … <span class="CharOverride-1">Daily Bread</span>, an arrangement of Scripture, that the Bible might be read through in the course of a year” (p. 159). Returning to his parish on 1 March 1843 and “weakened by his unceasing exertions” preaching in northern Scotland, he was “more than ordinarily exposed to the typhus fever that was then prevailing in his parish, several cases of which he visited in his enfeebled state” (p. 161). He caught the disease and died on the morning of 25 March 1843 (pp. 162, 164). He was buried in the cemetery of St. Peter’s Church, Dundee, on 30 March 1843 (p. 165). A memorial written by the Rev. J. Roxburgh movingly summed up his character: </p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">Whether viewed as a son, a brother, a friend, or a pastor, often has the remark been made by those who knew him most intimately, that he was the most faultless and attractive exhibition of the true Christian which they had ever seen embodied in a living form. His great study was to be Christ-like. He was a man of remarkable singleness of heart. He lived but for one object – the glory of the Redeemer in connection with the salvation of immortal souls. Hence, he carried with him a kind of hallowing influence into every company into which he entered, and his brethren were accustomed to feel as if all were well when their measures met with the sanction and approval of Mr. McCheyne. He was, indeed, the object of an esteem and reverence altogether singular toward so young a man, and which had their foundation in the deep and universal conviction of his perfect integrity of purpose, his unbending sincerity and truthfulness, his Christian generosity of spirit, and in the persuasion that he was a man who lived near to God, as was evident from his holy walk, his spiritual and heavenly-minded frame, and his singularly amiable and affectionate temper and disposition.

Its external appearance had not changed by the 1850s, but had been enhanced in recent times by the presence of luxury stores rivalling some of the best stores on the Nevskii Prospekt. Here there were individual shops selling, for example, mirrors, perfume, tobacco, china, table linens, yard goods, furniture, antiques, and paintings.

Later, the house was bought by the Prince of Oldenburg and decorated magnificently (Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, p.&#160;177; Nistrem, <span class="CharOverride-1">Adres-Kalendar’</span>, vol. 1, pp. 1, 33; E.A.

As Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna did not wish to leave Russia upon marriage (2/14 July 1839), he agreed to live in Russia.

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-169"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-169-backlink">169</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Military service was the most feared and heartbreaking obligation “imposed on the poll-tax population” (Elise Kimerling Wirtschafter, <span class="CharOverride-1">From Serf to Russian Soldier </span>(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1990), p.&#160;3). The period of service had been reduced from life to twenty-five years. In 1834, Nicholas I reduced it “to fifteen years for men with records of good conduct, who were put on indefinite leave for the balance of the term, with the obligation to perform six weeks work of service each year with the troops,” while “supernumerary troops, and cantonists (including Jews) … had their term shortened to twenty years, instead of fifteen” (John Shelton Curtiss, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Russian Army under Nicholas I, 1825–1855</span> [Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1965], p.&#160;252). Nevertheless, conscription continued to be considered a family tragedy, because it “meant a sudden and final break from home and family with little chance of return” and “deprived peasant society of able-bodied men,” thus “bringing economic ruin to individual families” (Wirtschafter, <span class="CharOverride-1">Serf to Soldier</span>, p.&#160;4). “The local community as a whole [also] paid a heavy economic price” (Wirtschafter, p.&#160;23): for example, it “bore the cost of outfitting and provisioning recruits for three months” (Wirtschafter, p.&#160;23). These tragedies and burdens were preceded by inequalities and variations that occurred in the distribution of the burden of conscription in its initial stage “in the peasant village or urban community,” inequalities and variations that “depended on the condition of the population, [on] the honesty of local officials, and [in the case of] private estates, on the landlord” (Wirtschafter, p.&#160;20). In 1838, a lottery system had been introduced, which “[r]eports from the 1840s and 1850s indicate … [was] considered … a success” by the government (Wirtschafter, pp. 22, 23). Nevertheless, the unassuaged fear of conscription continued to lead to running away and to self-mutilation on the part of recruits (Wirtschafter, pp. 5–8), engendering further family and community tragedies. “In most cases chance and arbitrariness … determined the order of selection” (Wirtschafter, p.&#160;25).</span></p>

In this remarkable entry, we learn for the first time in plain terms that she is pregnant and in fact in labor. Viewing her labor in euphemistic Victorian language as “symptoms of approaching illness,” but aware also of the very real danger that she may die in childbirth, having before her the examples of the two young grand duchesses, one of whom had died at approximately the same time a year before; surely frightened at the prospect of undergoing this experience in a strange land and with her family doctor absent; and having received news the evening before of a friend’s death, she records her thoughts and prayer that she be spared. Interrupted by a servant, who calls her to the window, she rises to look out, sees “Debos graceful form,” and weeps, perhaps as much for herself as for her step-daughter. She then returns to her diary and concludes her prayer, committing herself to God and accepting whatever will be, as she always has tried to do. In quoting Proverbs 27:1 – “Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth” – she replaces “day” with “night” so that the statement becomes specific to her situation: that it is night, and she is in labor and may die.</span></p>

His service record met the requirements for retirement in the rank then held by him with the right to continue wearing his uniform.

The writer says — “On that day (date left blank) we made Cape Race, Newfoundland. At that time our compasses, &amp;c., were in perfect order; on Sunday, the 12th, when we took observation, it proved we were 40 miles farther north than the distance we had run by the log, and the course we had steered should have placed us. This made the captain more alert, and it was remarked. About six o’clock this morning I came on deck. When I awoke the engines were stopped, and I heard the boatswain calling the soundings; knowing that we could not be in the soundings unless something was wrong, I dressed hurriedly, and on reaching the deck found we were close to land, with breakers all around us. No one knew where we were, nor could any one hazard more than a guess. At eight a.m. we made out a lighthouse, and then it was proved to be Nantucket; it was now only that we knew we were on the most dangerous coast and shoals on the Atlantic (west). We fired guns and hoisted the flags for a pilot; at nine a.m. sent a boat ashore, and procured a man, who, on boarding us, said, in reply to the question “What are you?” “a farmer and a fisherman.” However, he proved good at the bottom, and placed us in deep water. We then dodged about, firing guns, &amp;c., until at eleven a.m. a pilot was placed on board; he would not take us back to the place from whence we had entered on these shoals, and declared it a wonder how we had got through this danger without harm. Several coasting ships’ boats put off to us, and all asked what we wanted there. At times we only had 21 feet of water, and our vessel drew 16 to 17 feet; it was a trying time, and all agree in saying it was a most providential deliverance. At twelve a.m. Captain Hosken came below, and informed us that he could not undertake to convey the passengers to New York, unless he put into some port for a supply of coals, and he had consulted with the pilot, who had recommended Holmes’ Hole as a place where many coal vessels put in, taking coals to Boston. We had only sixteen hours’ coal on board (and that must be at half speed), whereas at that rate we could not make New York until two days; if we were to go at full speed, we should burn them up in a few hours. For Holmes’ Hole the ship was steered, and we anchored here at four p.m. Captain Hosken went ashore, and succeeded in purchasing a cargo, which we are now taking in about three miles from the village. My opinion of the <span class="CharOverride-1">Great Britain</span> is, that a finer model never was built, and her engines are good; but she is not rigged properly, and it is the fault of the directors, for Captain Hosken says he has protested against it from the commencement. It must also be accounted for why we were sent to sea with only sixteen days’ coal on board, and those sixteen days we did not work full speed; in fact, I do not believe that when the <span class="CharOverride-1">Great Britain </span>left Liverpool we had more than fifteen days’ coal on board, provided they had been burned in quantity to keep on the steam at full. Our screw had been altered again. I would only wish that those scientific men who try these experiments were to be compelled to trust themselves to them. How we got among the Nantucket shoals Captain Hosken should answer.”</p>

They returned home to prepare for a dinner party where the guests were Colonel Todd, Mr. Clay, Joseph Samuel Ropes, and Timothy Abraham Curtis and his daughter or daughter-in-law.

The total ironwork was to be nearly 10,000 tons and it was to take two years to complete. Unfortunately the project ran into trouble and the British press stopped reporting it while Soviet writers draw a complete veil over the whole affair. It seems likely that Bury, Curtis &amp; Kennedy had furnished an unduly low bid to get the contract and possibly payment was dilatory for after sending out the iron for three arches they withdrew in the first half of 1846. The firm then went downhill and ceased operations in 1850. (John G.

Although Todd had deposited “all the records and archives of the Legation with … Clay” in November 1845, his delay of his departure until the end of January 1846 meant that Clay lost three months’ salary as chargé d’affaires (for which he was eventually compensated). He served in this capacity until the new minister to Russia, Ralph Isaacs Ingersoll, arrived on 19 May 1847. Although Ingersoll had written Clay in October 1846, asking him to stay on as secretary of legation, Clay received an appointment on 3 March 1847, as chargé d’affaires to Peru (agreed to on his behalf by his brother, because there was not enough time to consult him in St. Petersburg before Congress adjourned).

It was located on the second floor of a building on the corner of Bol’shaia Morskaia Street and Brick Lane that formerly housed the Cosmorama. The owner was a Frenchman named Lemeault (no dates found), who ordered all the equipment for the theater from Paris. Performances were in French. The newspaper <span class="CharOverride-1">Severnaia pchela</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">The Northern Bee</span>] said of the puppet comedy: “the shows are intended mainly for children, although adults also are curious to have a look at the mechanical dolls.” One could see on the stage mnemonic heads, hanging freely in space on ribbons. They answered in Parisian French questions posed in French. Children also performed in this theater, taking part in <span class="CharOverride-1">tableaux vivantes</span> of rhythmic movement and mime. Magicians appeared here as well. In 1848, the theater was slated to be pulled down (Broitman and Krasnova, <span class="CharOverride-1">Bol’shaia Morskaia</span>, p.&#160;52; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, p.&#160;642; Konechnyi, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulki</span>, pp. 169, 303–304n124–125).

			<p class="Endnote-text4">The poliorama, or <span class="CharOverride-1">phoenix picture</span>,<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>is probably the panorama that so impressed James. It was a picture ten feet (three meters) in height and twenty feet (six meters) in length that at first appears clear and sharp to the viewer. Then suddenly it begins to grow pale, and the shapes of all the objects begin to become distorted or to disintegrate. Everything becomes covered by a kind of fog, out of which new forms begin to take shape and finally a new picture appears. For example, the picture shows a view of a castle in Switzerland in winter. Suddenly winter turns into summer and you see the same castle enveloped in greenery and finally you see the castle on fire (Konechnyi, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulki</span>, p.&#160;304n125).</p>

Through Sir Joseph Banks he accepted an appointment from the African Association and set out in May 1795 to discover “the true course of the Niger,” his predecessor in that attempt having disappeared without a trace. Subjected during his African journey to robbery, imprisonment, and near-death from fever, he returned to England in December 1797, having been unable to follow the river to its mouth. In 1799, his narrative of his travels was published to great success. Accepting a proposal for a second expedition to Africa, he departed England in January 1805, for the purpose now of exploring the Niger to the sea. As his party failed to reach the Niger before the onset of the rainy season, almost all of its members died of fever. Park continued on, but in the course of 1806 reports (confirmed in 1811) were received that he and his remaining party had been killed. On the eve of his departure on this fatal trip, he had written “a remarkable letter” to the secretary of state for the colonies, saying “though all Europeans who are with me should die, and though I were myself half dead, I would still persevere; and if I could not succeed in the object of my journey, I would at least die on the Niger” (<span class="CharOverride-1"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Park,_Mungo" target="_blank">Dictionary of National Biography</a></span>, s.v. “Park, Mungo”; Anderson, <span class="CharOverride-1">Scottish Nation</span>, vol. 3, pp. 272–275).

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-300"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-300-backlink">300</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Wright (Birmingham 2 March 1792 – London 30 March 1849; see <a href="images_8.html#image208" target="_blank">Image 208</a>) was “taken, when a child, to London and apprenticed to H. Meyer, the engraver.” He also “collaborated for four years with W.T. Fry, also an engraver.” He executed engraved, oil, pencil, and miniature portraits. He “exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1815–1848.” He went in 1822 to St. Petersburg at the behest of his brother-in-law, George Dawe (1781–1829), who had gone to St. Petersburg in 1819 at the invitation of Alexander I (see <a href="images_15.html#image418" target="_blank">Image 418</a>). Dawe had executed, according to this emperor’s plan, more than 400 portraits for the Military Gallery of the Winter Palace. These portraits were then engraved by Wright and by Henry Dawe, who announced in 1822 that they were preparing “The Collected Portraits of the Military Gallery.” The edition was to have consisted of a large number of portraits, but the published number was much smaller than had been projected. Wright next undertook to publish “Les contemporains russes,” consisting of a quarto edition of issues of twelve portraits each, but only the first issue appeared. For his works on engraving, Wright was elected a member of the Academy of Fine Arts of Stockholm and of Florence. The Imperial Academy of Fine Arts of St. Petersburg made him a candidate for academician in 1824. In 1826, he returned to England, where he engraved “The Beauties of the Court of Charles II.” He returned to St. Petersburg in 1830 to arrange the affairs of George Dawe, who had died in 1829. In 1833, after an exhibition of fifty-four engraved portraits by him, the St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts made him an honorary free associate. In 1836, he received the title of academician after submitting fourteen watercolor portraits. He is said to have returned to England in 1845. He died at George Street, Hanover Square, London in 1849.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Wright’s output of engraved portraits was enormous. In Russia alone he engraved eighty-six portraits and drawings, which are catalogued in D.A. Rovinskii, comp., <span class="CharOverride-1">Podrobnyi slovar’ russkikh gravyorov XVIII – XIX vv.</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">A Detailed Dictionary of Russian Engravers of the 18th – 19th Centuries</span>] [St. Petersburg: Imperatorskaia Akademiia Nauk, 1895], pp. 550–555).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">A large number of his watercolor portraits have also survived. He executed as well a number of pencil portraits. For example, in 1845 he executed a watercolor portrait of Anna Whistler that serves as the cover to this edition of the diaries (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Image 1</a>). On 27 March / 8 April 1846, he drew the portrait of William Ropes’s sister-in-law, Emily Hall (which means he cannot have left Russia permanently in 1845). In 1845 or 1846, he executed the pencil portraits of four members of the Ropes family and of William Clarke Gellibrand. These portraits are discussed in the biographies of the Ropes, Gellibrand, Prince and Hall families in <a href="36_ropes.html">Appendix&#160;E</a> (Polovtsov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Russkii biograficheskii slovar’</span>; Basil S.

The private ones listed in 1851 were Lauerbach’s in the house of Kurtz in the Novyi Pereulok and Reichenbach’s on the Chernaia Rechka Embankment at Count Stroganov’s dacha (Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, p.&#160;344). The British equivalent of this word is “manege.” Anna Whistler was using the pronunciation of her friends in St. Petersburg, which humourously suggests “ménage à trois.” For the Horse Guards’ manege in St. Petersburg, see <a href="images_6.html#image137" target="_blank">Image 137</a>.</span></p>

Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the exhibit. Catalogues in both Russian and English were produced. I was touched to read in the introductory essay by Dr. Galina Andreeva, head of Research and Projects of the State Tret’iakov Gallery, that my interest in young Whistler in Russia, which brought us together in the late 1980s, when I was in Petersburg and Moscow researching young Whistler and Koritskii, was the impetus for her interest in young Whistler and Russia that culminated in this exhibition, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and Mass Media of the Russian Federation, the Federal Agency for Culture and Cinematography, the State Tret’iakov Gallery, and the British Council [Ministerstvo kul’tury i massovykh kommunikatsii Rossiiskoi Federatsii, Federal’noe agentstvo po kul’ture i kinematografii, Gosudarstvennaia Tret’iakovskaia galereia, i Britanskii Sovet] (Galina Andreeva, “O proekte ‘Uistler i Rossiia’” [“Whistler and Russia Project”], in <span class="CharOverride-1">Uistler i Rossiia</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Whistler and Russia</span>], ed. Galina Andreeva and Margaret F. MacDonald [Moscow: SkanruS, 2006], p.&#160;11. This collection was issued in both a Russian version [<span class="CharOverride-1">Uistler i Rossiia</span>] and an English version [<span class="CharOverride-1">Whistler and Russia</span>]; the two will be cited separately. Andreeva, who was preparing in the late 1980s a brief biographical sketch of Alexander Osipovich Koritskii for an encyclopedia of artists of the USSR, gave me a copy of it (G.B. Andreeva, “Koritskii (Karitskii) Aleksandr Osipovich,” in <span class="CharOverride-1">Gosudarstvennaia Tret’iakovskaia Galereia: Katalog sobraniia.

As consultation of the catalogues for the 2006–2007 exhibit shows, Andreeva used the same sources as I did for Koritskii’s biography, but the portion of her essay dealing with him is geared towards the general public and substantially limits footnote references to the archival and printed sources on which it is based. Presenting details of his biography for the first time ever, her essay on Koritskii is valuable for all levels of readers of the catalogues. </p>

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-327"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-327-backlink">327</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the artists whose works appeared in the 1846 Triennial Exhibition was Émile-François Dessain (2 June 1808 – October 1882), a French artist then working in St. Petersburg. Dessain, a portrait, genre, and landscape painter, engraver, and lithographer, was born in Valenciennes. He was a student of Boisselier, and exhibited at the Salon de Paris from 1831 to 1844. A list of works executed by him between 1831 and 1844 may be found in Bellier de La Chavignerie and Auvray. Most biographical dictionaries indicate that he was in St. Petersburg in 1852, where he painted the entire Imperial family as well as members of the Vorontsov and Panin families. Thieme and Becker gives the years 1847 or 1852; however, as we see here, Dessain seems to have been in St. Petersburg in 1846. A calling card among the papers of Colin Ingersoll (see <a href="images_11.html#image280" target="_blank">Image 280</a>), who arrived in St. Petersburg in 1847, shows that Dessain was then also in St. Petersburg. Dessain’s calling card announced that he lived at the apartment of Mrs. Delapré in the house belonging to Kitner at No. 10 Stable Bridge (<span class="CharOverride-1">Koniushennyi most</span>) on the Moika River (Ralph McAllister Ingersoll Collection, box 35, BUHG).

			<p class="Endnote-text4">I believe that the portrait of a boy who resembled James was one of the six pastel portraits by Dessain. It has not been possible to identify or locate any of these six pastel portraits. Sometime after 29 April 1846, when Major and Anna Whistler attended the Triennial Exhibition, and an unspecifiable date in 1847, Dessain undertook to execute an oval double portrait of James and Willie in pastel (see <a href="images_1.html#image27" target="_blank">Image 27</a>). I believe that viewing Dessain’s pastel portraits was the impetus for the Whistlers’ commission to him. A similar portrait by an unknown artist of James and Willie in the Jourdan school uniforms, attributed to c. 1846, which is in the Hunterian Art Gallery of the University of Glasgow, may be the copy made by Koritskii and exhibited at the Academy in December 1848 (see “fotografiia s originala” [“a photograph of a portrait”], in Dr. Georgia Toutziari “Sem’ia Uistlerov v Rossii,” in Andreeva and MacDonald, <span class="CharOverride-1">Uistler i Rossiia</span>).</p>

He studied at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts from 1809–1818, where his teachers were A. Ye. Yegorov (1776–1851), A.I. Ivanov (1775–1848), and V.K. Shebuev (1777–1855). He spent 1819–1836 and 1838–1841 in Italy as a pensioner of the Academy. It is here that his most famous painting, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Brass Serpent</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Mednyi zmii</span>), was executed (see following Note 329 and <a href="images_7.html#image184" target="_blank">Image 184</a>). He was appointed academician in 1834, professor of history painting in 1836, and rector of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Academy in 1855. He participated in the decoration of the Kazan and St. Isaac’s cathedrals (see <a href="images_6.html#image119" target="_blank">Images 119–120</a>, <a href="images_6.html#image126" target="_blank">126</a>) in St. Petersburg and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow. From 1849–1864, he was the curator of the Picture Gallery of the Hermitage. He aided in the transformation of the Hermitage from a palace museum into a public museum in all aspects, including the way it was set up: structure, staff, the plan for the formation of the collection, rights and duties of its staff; arrangement of expositions, lighting and hanging of pictures; regulations for inventory and preservation, and rules for visitor access. During his curatorship, the construction of the New Hermitage was completed (see <a href="images_6.html#image113" target="_blank">Image 113</a>). In 1856–1859, under his direction, the inventories of all palace paintings were compiled, serving as the basic inventories of the museum until 1924. He participated in the acquisition of several great collections, including the gallery of Barbarigo, which was the source of almost all the paintings by Titian in the Hermitage, and part of the collection of the Dutch King Wilhelm II comprising chiefly fifteenth-century Dutch artists. Bruni died in St. Petersburg and was buried in the Catholic Cemetery in the Vyborg district (<span class="CharOverride-1">Rossiiskaia muzeinaia </span><span lang="ar-SA">è</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ntsiklopedia </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">Encyclopedia of Russian Museums</span>], 2 vols. [Moscow: Progress–Ripol klassik, 2001], vol. 1, p.&#160;81). He was Aleksandr Osipovich Koritskii’s superior at the Hermitage. Given Bruni’s attempt to have inventories of all palace paintings drawn up, it is understandable that the disorderly Koritskii was in difficulties, as he was unable to perform this duty satisfactorily (see Koritskii in <a href="22_koritskii.html">Appendix&#160;E</a> and <a href="images_7.html#image167" target="_blank">Images 167–170</a>).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-329"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-329-backlink">329</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The translation of the Russian title (<span class="CharOverride-1">Mednyi zmii</span>) is “<span class="CharOverride-1">The Brass Serpent</span>” (see <a href="images_7.html#image184" target="_blank">Image 184</a>). The subject of the painting is taken from Numbers 21:4–9. When Moses was leading his people through the desert, they were discouraged and frequently murmured against God and him. God therefore sent fiery serpents whose bites caused many of them to die. Those who remained alive beseeched Moses to ask God to take the serpents away. God commanded Moses to make a fiery serpent and place it on a pedestal. If a live serpent bit someone, that person had only to look at the sacred object and was healed. Moses made a brass serpent and put it up and it was as God had said.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">As early as December 1824, in Rome, N.I. Turgenev (1789–1871) had seen Bruni’s sketch for this painting. A letter from Bruni to the Society for Aid to Artists in St. Petersburg in early February 1827 indicates that he hoped to conclude his studies in Rome with this large work and to return home with it. The Society tried to dissuade him from a subject that was so complex and required so many figures, but Bruni did not wish to give it up. In 1835, Nicholas I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>), who had recalled Bruni (see <a href="images_7.html#image183" target="_blank">Image 183</a>), was persuaded by the Russian ambassador in Rome to let him remain there until January 1836 to finish his picture, but by spring of 1836 it still was not finished. On arriving in St. Petersburg that summer, Bruni was appointed “professor second class in history and portrait painting” with all the perquisites of the position. In September 1838, he left Russia again for Italy. It was not until 15 April 1841 that <span class="CharOverride-1">The Brass Serpent</span> was finished. Bruni sent it to Russia at the end of June. In September, it was put on exhibit at the Winter Palace and then taken to the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, where it was exhibited in the fall of 1842. Bruni was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 4<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> Class, and Nicholas I bought the painting for thirty thousand paper rubles. It was thus part of the permanent collection, which Anna Whistler viewed as well.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">It is a matter of debate whether Bruni’s painting is filled with “countenances beaming with Faith” and the “gloomy contrast … those make who will not look &amp; be saved!” I personally see no one “beaming with Faith” and consider Anna Whistler’s interpretation wishful thinking. Academician Fyodor Grigorievich Solntsev (1801–1876) is the source of a similar doubtful view on the part of Russian’s great fabulist Ivan Andreevich Krylov (see <a href="images_8.html#image186" target="_blank">Image 186</a>), who, he says, almost never openly expressed an opinion about the fine arts. Krylov said that if he were married, he would never bring his wife to see Bruni’s painting, because it contains only suffering and not a single person who is not ailing and can be called righteous. Solntsev, himself a painter, agreed with Krylov. He said <span class="CharOverride-1">The Brass Serpent</span> had a heavy, stifling effect. Most of the people in it were prostrated on the ground. Not a single one wins the viewer to himself. All is suffering and death. The boy in the foreground has already putrified. Moses and Aaron are in the background and resemble sorcerers. This is because Bruni borrowed the subject from Moses but failed to grasp its meaning. Solntsev felt that while the painting hung in the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, it almost served simply as a partition separating one salon from another, because it was considered to have little worth. This is where it was hanging when Anna Whistler saw it (F.G. Solntsev, “Moia zhizn’ i khudozhestvenno-arkheologicheskie trudy, rasskaz akademika F.G. Solntseva” [“My Life and Artistic-Archaeological Works, told by Academician F.G. Solntsev”], <span class="CharOverride-1">Russkaia starina</span> 15 [March 1876]: p.&#160;623).</p>

Its construction in 1829–1832 was made necessary by the development of the port of Petersburg in the first half of the nineteenth century, when customs facilities could no longer fit into the old houses adapted for them on the bank of the Little Neva. In its silhouette, the Customs House, designed in the forms of Russian Classicism, matches the Kunstkamera, which is located symmetrically with respect to the axis of the ensemble of the spit of Vasilievskii Island. Rectangular in plan, the main façade of the Customs House faces the Little Neva and is crowned by a sloping cupola on a tall drum. The main façade is distinguished by an Ionic portico that rests against the projection of the first floor, which is treated as the ground floor and is rusticated. On the pediment crowning the portico are bronze statues of Mercury, Neptune, and Ceres (<span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury Leningrada</span> 1958, p.&#160;97).</span></p>

The first Sir James Wylie (Kincardine-on-Forth 1768 – St. Petersburg 11/23 February 1854), knighted in 1814, had been physician to emperors Paul I (see <a href="images_15.html#image417" target="_blank">Image 417</a>) and Alexander I (see <a href="images_15.html#image418" target="_blank">Image 418</a>). The second Sir James Wylie (bap. Dundee 7 January 1795 – St. Petersburg 9/21 October 1850) was his nephew, son of his older brother, William, a minister in Dundee. This younger Sir James Wylie (see <a href="images_11.html#image298" target="_blank">Image 298</a>) was physician to Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, brother of Emperor Nicholas I, and was knighted in 1843. He had a brother, John (bap. Dundee 23 January 1793 – Carluke 15 December 1873), who was ordained on 1 May 1818 and was a minister in Carluke, Scotland, from 1818 until his death in 1873; and a brother, Francis (1806 – Elgin 19 March 1873), a minister in Elgin from 1843 until his death, also in 1873. As Anna Whistler spoke of the visiting minister, who preached on 17 May, as “past the prime of life,” he would more likely have been John, who would have been at least 53 years old, rather than Francis, who would have been only 40. This seems confirmed by the fact that a John Wylie was a witness at the marriage of Henry Richard Cattley and Mary Ann Wilks on 17/29 May 1846 in the English Church, and that he only appears in an entry for Wylie on this one occasion in May 1846 (PREC STP, no. 5609; <span class="CharOverride-1">OPRS</span>; <span class="CharOverride-1"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Wylie,_James_(1768-1854)" target="_blank">Dictionary of National Biography</a></span>, s.v. “Wylie, Sir James 1768–1854)”; Scott, <span class="CharOverride-1">Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae</span>, vol. 3, <span class="CharOverride-1">Synod of Glasgow &amp; Ayr</span>, p.&#160;286, and vol. 6, <span class="CharOverride-1">Synods of Aberdeen and of Moray</span>, p.&#160;392; <span class="CharOverride-1">The Elgin Courant</span>, March 21, 1873; <span class="CharOverride-1">The Scotsman</span>, May 2, 1890).

There are conflicting stories about which parent started the candy business that became so famous. One version says it was their mother who, in order to support them, made a molasses candy, which her sons sold. With the profits, she opened a small candy shop on the lower west side of New York. In 1828, her sons formed the partnership of R.L. and A. Stuart and continued in the confectionery business until 1856, but their chief business until the 1870s was the refining and marketing of sugar. From this enterprise they amassed great wealth and throughout their lives engaged in extensive philanthropy (<span class="CharOverride-1">Dictionary of American Biography</span>, s.v. “Stuart, Robert Leighton”; Matthew Hale Smith, <span class="CharOverride-1">Twenty Years among the Bulls and Bears of Wall Street</span> [Hartford, CT: J.B.

Huge crowds of people were waiting for the Empress before the Palace as well and demonstrated their happiness with unfeigned signs of genuine attentiveness. In the evening the entire city was lit with fire—the eloquent emblem of ardent Russian feeling. In different parts of Petersburg various forms of illumination were especially arranged for this event. Many public and private buildings were illuminated with extraordinary magnificence, but the Nevskii Prospekt and the streets adjacent to it from the Znamenskii Bridge to the Admiralty was an almost sheer wall of fire, displaying the greatest artifice and variety of form … Before the entire length of the façade of almost every house sparkled thousands of fires in the form of arches, pyramids, palms and gigantic stars with the initials of the August Heroine of the festivities. Some houses were covered with fire from top to bottom – from roof to sidewalk. In some squares and on the balconies of some houses loud music sounded. The entire populace of Petersburg, given the calm, warm weather, massed in dense crowds until late at night on the Nevskii Prospekt, on Bol’shaia and Malaia Morskaia streets and on other nearby streets, engaging in this truly national celebration with reverential quiet and order.

Certainly Baird was a delegate from the Synod of New Jersey of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, but Rankin and Brinsmade probably were as well. They had all come to Europe early: Baird to attend first the temperance convention in Stockholm in June; Brinsmade and Rankin for perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime tour (their biographies contain contradictory statements about their travels). They had joined Baird in London, and were traveling with him (Henry M. Baird, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Life of the Rev. Robert Baird, D.D.</span> [New York: Anson D.F.

A passport (no. 383) was issued to him, a resident of New York, on 29 May 1846 for Hamburg and Sweden. He was vouched for by Rev. H.N. Brinsmade (NAUS: Passports, RG84, C18.3). It is not possible to say whether Henry N. Beach had come to Europe to attend the meeting in London in August 1846 that the clergymen were to attend, concerning the formation of an Evangelical Alliance. On 6 October 1847, Henry married Martha W. Crane, daughter of the late Rev. Elias W. Crane of Jamaica, Long Island (now part of Brooklyn).

Passaic Co. was not created until 1837 and Paterson Twp. lay south of the River in Essex Co.” (James Ward, Passaic County Historical Society, Paterson, NJ, to E. Harden, 24 September 1991). Maxwell quotes Major Whistler as saying that his family was “then living in a house belonging to Morris, the son in law of Peter [Crory?] on the banks of the Pasaic” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, June 2, 1844, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 36).

He was ordained in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, on 23 April 1844. He was pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Springfield, New Jersey, from 1844 to 1850. He is said to have “made an extensive tour in Europe” in 1845 and then to have “resumed his pastoral duty at Springfield.” It is not possible to say whether he went to Europe more than once, but we know for certain that he traveled in Europe in 1846. From 1850 to 1863, he was pastor of the Forty-Second Street Church in New York City. In 1863, he received a DD from Rutgers College. “He was in the service of the Christian Commission during the … civil war.” From 1866 to 1879, he was pastor of the Congregational Church in Fairfield, Connecticut. He resigned this post because of failing health and returned to Newark, where he died ten years later.</span></p>

He “was born on a … farm.” At fifteen he entered the Academy of Uniontown (1813), followed by Washington College (1816–1817) and Jefferson College (BA, 1818). “Both colleges sought to encourage promising farm boys to enter the Presbyterian ministry.” Baird decided to attend Princeton Theological Seminary, from which he graduated in 1822. He was principal of Princeton Academy from 1822 to 1828. As his career progressed, he moved from “state missionary work” to national to French to international, developing along the way the abilities of a consummate fundraiser. The missionary zeal he brought to whatever he undertook resulted eventually in an extremely peripatetic life. His great interest in “establish[ing] …a proper school system in the state” of New Jersey prompted him to write an influential “series of letters on education ‘To the People of New Jersey.’”</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">He was considered by “President McLean of Princeton [to have done] more than any other man ‘to direct the public attention to this subject and to induce the Legislature to pass the requisite laws for the establishment and maintenance of a system of common schools.’” His next interest was Sunday schools. In 1829, he became “general agent of the American Sunday School Union,” a post he held for five years and in the service of which he “founded thousands of schools” “all over the settled parts of the United States,” even where there were no churches. “In 1834 the French Association,” funded “by wealthy Huguenot émigrés” (Baird had married on 24 August 1824 in Philadelphia Fermine Du Boisson of Huguenot descent), was founded in New York “to aid the Protestant Church in France.” They sent Baird to be “their agent … in Paris.” While there, he “attempted to begin an international temperance movement [resembling] the American Temperance Society.” It was then that he wrote <span class="CharOverride-1">Histoire des Sociétés de Temperance des </span><span lang="ar-SA">États</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> Unis d’Amérique</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">History of the Temperance Societies of the United States of America</span>] (1836). Although the French Association changed, developing finally into the American and Foreign Christian Union, “he “remained in its service” until his death. He eventually “became an ardent advocate of the Evangelical Alliance for the Protestant world.” In the service of the French Association and its transformations, “he crossed the ocean nine times and travelled more than 300,000 miles.” He was the author of some nine books, written between 1832 and 1851.

A letter from William Whistler to James in England mentions simply “Franziska’s” (St. Petersburg, Oct. 2-3 [1848], GUL: Whistler Collection, W974). Franciska was probably foreign, as her name suggests, and because English seems not to have been her native language. As Anna Whistler called her “this girl,” she may not have been married. It has also not been possible to ascertain who her aunt was.</span></p>

The subjects taught there were religion and sacred history, reading and writing in Russian, the elements of arithmetic, concepts of home economics, and needlework of all kinds, from ordinary to the finest sewing and embroidery. Every trimester, the girls were subjected to exams. Girls who excelled in deportment, their studies, and work experience received a monetary award when they graduated, based on whether they left after three, five, or seven years. Their needlework was sold on the Nevskii Prospekt in the house of Princess Golitsyna. Girls from various free classes of society were accepted year round on the basis of requests from their parents or benefactors. With the exception of holidays, the girls were required to come to school every day in the morning. They had dinner at the school and went home in the evening. In addition to paying for their meals, the Society supplied them with clothing and shoes paid for from their earnings. Girls were accepted from the ages of five to fourteen. They were required to undergo a physical examination to enter, and, if not vaccinated for small pox, to be vaccinated immediately. Preference was given to those who were complete orphans or lived in conditions of extreme poverty (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, pp. 477–479).</p>

He became a count in 1847, when Nicholas I created his father, Vladimir Fyodorovich (1792–1884), and all his descendents counts of the Russian Empire. Vladimir Fyodorovich’s relationship with Nicholas I was identical to that of his son with Alexander II: they were lifelong friends, and Vladimir Fyodorovich preceded his son as minister of the Court (1852–1870).

Trinity Church was established as the parish church of New York in 1697. The original Trinity Church building, completed on this same spot in 1698, was destroyed by “the great fire that swept through New York city on September 21, 1776.” Construction of the second church was begun in 1788, and the building was consecrated in 1790. As a result of its structure being weakened by the “weight of heavy snows in the winter of 1838–39,” it was torn down and replaced by the third and present building, which is in gothic Revival style, designed by Richard Upjohn (1802–1878). For most of the remaining nineteenth century it was the tallest building in New York and visible from a great distance, as panoramas of the city clearly show. Anna Whistler speaks of it as “old mother Trinity,” reflecting the title “Mother of Churches” bestowed on it in the first thirty years of the nineteenth century when, as a result of New York’s growing and spreading population, it helped to fund “seventy separate parishes over a large geographical area.” It is now registered as a National Historic Landmark (“History of Trinity Parish Three Centuries of Service,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Trinity News</span> 43, no. 1 (1996): pp. 8–11; Paul Spencer Byard, “Appreciating Trinity’s Church: An Anniversary View of a Landmark,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Trinity News </span>43, no. 1 (1996): pp. 12–15; “City News,” <span class="CharOverride-1">New-York Commercial Advertiser,</span> Monday, June 1, 1846, p.&#160;2; <span class="CharOverride-1">New-York Commercial Advertiser</span>, Thursday, June 4, 1846, p.&#160;1; “City News,” <span class="CharOverride-1">New-York Commercial Advertiser,</span> Saturday, June 8, 1846, p.&#160;2; Paul Goldberger, “God’s Stronghold at Mammon’s Door,” The Metro section, <span class="CharOverride-1">New York Times</span>, May 14, 1996, pp. Bl–B2).</span></p>

(Hopkinton, NH 11 November 1804 – Brunswick, ME 14 November 1870) graduated from the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church in New York in 1829 (Calvin R. Batchelder, <span class="CharOverride-1">A History of the Eastern Diocese</span>, 3 vols. [Claremont, NH: Claremont Manufacturing, 1876], vol. 1, p.&#160;486). He was ordained deacon in St. Paul’s Chapel in New York on 5 July 1828 and priest in St. Andrew’s Church in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, on 16 September 1830 (Batchelder, p.&#160;486). On “August 16, 1829, he took charge of St. Luke’s Church, Charlestown, N.H.” (Batchelder, p.&#160;486). He also officiated in two other churches in Drewsville and Perkinsville, Vermont (Batchelder, p.&#160;486). He was elected rector of St. Stephen’s Church in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in October 1831 and took up his position on 7 December 1832, the day the church was consecrated (J.E.A. Smith, <span class="CharOverride-1">The History of Pittsfield (Berkshire County) Massachusetts, from the Year 1800 to the Year 1876</span> [Springfield, [MA]: C.W. Bryan, 1876], p.&#160;456). While considered “an excellent preacher” (Smith, p.&#160;456), “it was not chiefly as a pastor that [he] became endeared to the people of Pittsfield … This was due rather to his daily walk and conversation, which won the esteem of every class, and to the gentle and benign manner which charmed all who came in contact with him” (Smith, p.&#160;457). “He was for many years a member of the town school-committee” and worked for the Bible Society and in the temperance movement (Smith, p.&#160;457). Nevertheless, because his ability to attract new parishioners “was not so rapid as the impatient founders of the parish craved,” he was forced to resign (Smith, p.&#160;457). He resigned on 20 September 1847, but “remained until February, 1848” (Kate M. Schutt, <span class="CharOverride-1">The First Century of St. Stephen’s Parish 1830–1930 </span>[Pittsfield, MA: s.n., 1930], p.&#160;33). This forced resignation “excited great feeling in the parish, … proved a lasting injury to it” and served as a precedent for similar treatment of several of his successors (Smith,<span class="CharOverride-1"> History of Pittsfield</span>, pp. 458–459). He then became rector of St. Michael’s Church in Marblehead, Massachusetts (Batchelder, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of the Eastern Diocese</span>, p.&#160;486). “He resigned this parish in 1852, and became the Principal of the Episcopal Academy of Connecticut … until 1858” (Batchelder, p.&#160;486).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">In 1858, he was made rector of St. Paul’s Church in Brunswick, Maine, where “his abilities were at once recognized” (Smith,<span class="CharOverride-1"> History of Pittsfield</span>, p.&#160;457). He preached here until the day before his death (Batchelder, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of the Eastern Diocese</span>, p.&#160;486). He was awarded the AM by Dartmouth College in 1830, by Trinity College in 1845, and by Bowdoin College in 1858. He was awarded the degree of STD by Trinity College in 1865 (Batchelder, p.&#160;487). “From 1865 to 1868, he was State Superintendent of Public Schools” (Batchelder, p.&#160;487). “In 1859, he became a member of the Maine Historical Society” and from 1861 until his death was its Secretary (Smith,<span class="CharOverride-1"> History of Pittsfield</span>, p.&#160;457; Batchelder, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of the Eastern Diocese</span>, p.&#160;487).

Count Stroganov’s servants sold food and drink at a modest price by taking it from his own larders. In the 1830s, on his land near the New Village (<span class="CharOverride-1">Novaia Derevnia</span>), a pleasure garden was built for a mineral water establishment. Variety shows were presented; Herman’s orchestra, which had been playing at Pavlovsk, played concerts there two evenings a week. Later, the garden was completely enclosed by a high fence, rented out to an entrepreneur, and the public had to pay to enter. One of the most famous entrepreneurs from 1848 to the end of the 1850s was Isler, who had previously had a small café and restaurant in the building of the Armenian Church on the Nevskii Prospekt. In 1859, he was running another such establishment: the “Monde Brilliant.” He was considered to have a talent for attracting the public in droves. During his time at the pleasure garden, Ivan Gungl’s orchestra played there, Ivan Vasiliev’s gypsy choir began singing there, and a troup of Arab acrobats was introduced. When the cholera appeared, Isler did all he could to divert the distressed public. Nicholas I visited the establishment, witnessed the acrobatic act, and personally thanked Isler for the pleasure he was giving the public; after his visit, he made Isler a gift of three thousand rubles. Later, Isler built an open theater there, where <span class="CharOverride-1">tableaux vivantes</span> and fireworks were presented; in 1862, the French chanson was introduced; later, operettas. At the end of the 1860s, the establishment began to decline. In 1876, the pleasure garden stood empty, and in August of that year it burned down. Isler, who had ceased to be an entrepreneur by 1874, died in 1877 and was buried in the Smolensk Cemetery (Pyliaev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zabytoe proshloe</span> 1889, pp. 6–12; Konechnyi, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulki</span>, p.&#160;276n29; Petrovskaia, <span class="CharOverride-1">Kontsertnaia zhizn’ Peterburga</span>, pp. 22, 36, 37, 69, 79).</span></p>

The founding of the cathedral is said to be 30 May (OS) 1714, on which day the Most Reverend Isaac of Dalmatia is celebrated and the birth of Peter the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image411" target="_blank">Image 411</a>) is remembered. The cathedral was completed during the reign of Anna Ioannovna and dedicated on 28 June 1733. On 30 April 1756, lightning struck the belfry spire and the cathedral caught fire, with the cupola and iconostasis suffering the severest damage. They were restored to their original state. At this time, there were two altars: that of the apostles Peter and Paul, and that of the great martyr St. Catherine, built in 1773. The length of the cathedral along the foundations is thirty sazhens, the width fourteen. Inside, the length is twenty-seven sazhens five feet, the width eleven sazhens one foot. The interior of the altar is four sazhens three feet, its length eight sazhens two feet. The height from the floor to the vaulting is seven sazhens one foot. Within the cathedral, four columns support the cupola and two the altar. On the right side by a column is the seat of the emperor, under a velvet baldachine with the Russian coat-of-arms and crowns. Next to this seat is another for the Imperial family. The inner side of the vaulting has been made to look like marble and is decorated with cherubim. The floor is made of polished tile variegated in color. Among the treasures of the cathedral is a large censer carved of ivory ten feet high, six feet in diameter, and up to eighteen feet in circumference, made by Peter the Great. </span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text4">The cathedral has above its altar a large cupola and belltower, ending in a sharp spire on which there is an apple supporting an angel with a cross. Attached to it is a lightning rod. The height of the belltower from its base to the top of the cross is sixty-five sazhens; excluding the cross fifty-seven sazhens. The height of the spire together with the apple is twenty-six sazhens. The spire is covered with gilded brass sheets, while for the gilding of its upper decorations twenty-two pounds of pure gold was used. All of this was done in October 1830. Clocks with chimes were bought by Peter the Great in Amsterdam, but in 1759, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image413" target="_blank">Image 413</a>) bought new ones to replace those ruined during a storm.

Anna Whistler does not indicate which version she owned. In a letter to Major Whistler in 1847, she refers to the volume she received as a gift many years earlier: “‘The Poor Man’s Portion’ it was you who years ago led me to the study of that valuable work by bringing me a copy of it in your trunk from Philadelphia” (Anna Whister to George Washington Whistler, Steamer “Staat Hamburg” Lubec entry for June 10th 1847 in letter of Tuesday Morning June 8th 1847 [on board] Steamer Nikolai, GUL: Whistler Collection, W353). This means that the purchase could have been made at any time after their marriage in November 1831, but not after May 1842, when Major Whistler was on his way to St. Petersburg. As <span class="CharOverride-1">The Poor Man’s Morning Portion</span> was reissued singly at least in 1833, she could have owned either the single or combined version.</span></p>

In June the warm weather changed everywhere to a heat wave that has continued up to mid-August. In Arkhangelsk and Petrozavodsk the heat rose, on 10 July, to 24° Reaumur in the shade. No one will forget such a hot summer as the present one for a long time. Thank God, however, that there is no report from anywhere of drought: the intense heat has been tempered from time to time by rain, but in some places the rain has even been extremely excessive, with floods resulting. In the North the unusual heat continues everywhere almost to this moment. In the South the summer has been exactly the same as in the North and in Central Russia: in Simferopol, for example, the heat at the end of June reached 28° Reaumur.

She had taken the post with grave doubts because of the possible impropriety, even at the age of 48, of entering the service of the widowed Archibald Mirrielees, whose second wife, Mary (Cullen) Mirrielees, had died that year (Archibald Mirrielees to John Paterson, Reval, 31 July / 12 August 1839, LMS: Incoming Letters, vol. 3, no. 52; Pitcher, <span class="CharOverride-1">Muir and Mirrielees</span>, pp. 16, 18, 28, 30). Sometime after Archibald Mirrielees’s marriage in July 1844 to his third wife, Jane (Muir) Mirrielees (1810–1875), Miss Funck went back into service to the Gellibrands. She is the Mlle.

It was erected in 1845 and executed by the master of marble monuments, Paolo Catozzi (Pavel Ivanovich) (c. 1800 – after 1868), from a design by Andrei Ivanovich Shtakenshneider (1802–1865), Nicholas I’s favorite architect. The marble statue was the work of Giovanni Vitali (Ivan Petrovich) (1794–1855), professor of sculpture at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. The statue stood in a small open marble pavilion, in front of which were several steps leading up to a platform of Serdobol granite (gray) with benches of the same granite and a parapet for flowers, its four corners decorated with urns made of dark sionite. On the pediment of the pavilion was the inscription in Old Church Slavonic: “Lord, Thy will be done.” Within the pavilion on one side wall were set down the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3–11); on the other, Christ’s words: “Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light” (Matthew 11: 29–30). These inside walls were decorated with Byzantine ornamentation. The word “Parmetnic,” which Anna Whistler uses, is the Russian word for “monument,” spelled “pamiatnik” and pronounced “pah&#8242;mitnyeek.” The resemblance of the statue to the Grand Duchess was striking; the profile in particular was said to be identical (RGIA: Fond 485, op. 3, d. 656. <span lang="pl-PL">Tsarskoe Selo.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">An inventory exists for 1860, stating that one terrace had a table and armchairs made of ash, some mats, and a spittoon. The other had a folding table made of ash, simple wooden furniture painted brown (couch, chairs, armchairs with and without cushions, footstools), and a spittoon. The first room had two curtained windows, a table, chairs, and a cupboard of ash; a tray, decanter, and drinking glass; and a portable toilet. The second room had two curtained windows, white birch furniture (couch and chairs, Voltaire chair, desk, small table, footstool), and a spittoon. There were also two cupboards in the hut (RGIA: Fond 469. op. 15, d. 405. <span lang="pl-PL">Opis’ imushchestva domika v Tsarskosel’skom parke u pamiatnika vel. kn. </span>Aleksandry Nikolaevny. 1860 g. [Inventory of the furnishings of the little house in the Tsarskoe Selo park near the monument to Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna. 1860]). It is not possible to say whether this is the same furniture that was there in the 1840s. After his daughter’s death, Nicholas I would often come sit here in the evening in a big leather armchair which, legend has it, was one of some pieces brought here from her room (the others were a leather couch and a desk). Everything else – i.e., the garden-type furniture made of ash – Vil’chkovskii wrote in 1911, was made by the German furniture firm of Heinrich Gambs (1765–1831) in 1845. His firm supplied furniture to the Court from 1809 or 1810 until 1848 (Dm. Ivanov, “Gambsova mebel’” [“Furniture by Gambs”], <span class="CharOverride-1">Sredi kollektsionerov</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Among Collectors</span>] 5–6<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>[May–June 1922]: p.&#160;30).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">In her memoirs, Baroness Frederiks said that Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna wanted to make a surprise for her parents when she was ill and ordered a little rustic wooden house to be built on one of the small islands in the park, where she frequently spent time with her mother, for whom she intended it as a kind of remembrance of herself when she should leave her family and country with her husband. But the surprise was not ready until after her death. In the house hung a small watercolor portrait of her with her own words inscribed: “Je sais que le plus grand plaisir de papa c’est d’en faire à maman!” (Frederiks, “Iz vospominanii,” pp. 86–87; see also <span class="CharOverride-1">Son iunosti</span>, pp. 163–164).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-487"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-487-backlink">487</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna Whistler and her family visited the oratory in the New (Alexander) Palace on 7/19 August 1846 (see <a href="images_14.html#image388" target="_blank">Images 388</a>, <a href="images_16.html#image447" target="_blank">447</a>). It, too, was built by D. Ye. Yefimov. In creating the oratory, the empress’s dressing room, bedroom, dining room, and large and small studies were reorganized as to function: e.g., the dining room became the bedroom, the bedroom became the dining room, the small study became the dressing room. That area of the large study in which Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna had died was made into a separate room, which became the oratory (see <a href="images_16.html#image452" target="_blank">Image 452</a>). The measurements of what is referred to in archival documents as “the little room” were approximately eight arshins long, four wide, and five high. In 1845, the walls and vaulted ceiling were decorated with ornamentation on a gilded background in the spirit of that in the oratory of Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich (father of Peter the Great) in the Kremlin chambers. The ornamentation was based on a drawing executed by Academician Fyodor Grigorievich Solntsev (1801–1892). On the walls, interspersed with the ornamentation, were four icons: on the back wall saints Olga and Maria, and on the left wall Nicholas of Myra and Tsaritsa Aleksandra. In the center of the ceiling was depicted the God of Sabaoth. Other figures on the ceiling were the four Evangelists; the apostles Peter and Paul; the great martyr St. Catherine; the sainted Prince Vladimir; the sainted Emperor Constantine and his wife, St. Helena; Michael the Archangel; and St. Nikolai Kochanov of Novgorod. The doors were of mahogany and the bay of gilded brass slabs. On the walls were two glass-covered cases of gilded lindenwood with columns interwoven with ornamentation. In these cases were icons belonging to the deceased Grand Duchess, including wedding icons from 1844 and others from 1825 celebrating her birth. Among the icons were several in which the Virgin is adorned with a diamond tiara. There was also a lectern of ash, a partition <span class="CharOverride-1">(stanok) </span>made of walnut, and steps covered with a raspberry-colored fleecy woollen cloth like velvet <span class="CharOverride-1">(trip), </span>all made by Gambs when the oratory was built. On the right wall hung Karl Pavlovich Briullov’s (1799–1852) <span class="CharOverride-1">St. Alexandra Ascending into Heaven </span>(<span class="CharOverride-1">Sviataia Aleksandra, voznosiashchaiasia na nebo</span>), executed in 1845 (see <a href="images_16.html#image453" target="_blank">Image 453</a>). James Whistler considered it “the most interesting of all the works of art around us,” because he probably knew Briullov, who was the mentor of his drawing teacher, Koritskii (see Koritskii in <a href="22_koritskii.html">Appendix&#160;E</a> and <a href="images_7.html#image167" target="_blank">Images 167–170</a>). Commissioned by the officers of the Preobrazhenskii Regiment for their regimental church, it was presented to Nicholas I and placed in the oratory. In the painting, the Grand Duchess’s face is depicted as the face of the holy martyr Tsaritsa Aleksandra (Frederiks, “Iz vospominanii,” p.&#160;86). In her monumental monograph on Briullov, <span lang="ar-SA">È</span>sfir Atsarkina says of this painting: </span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">Briullov used an already-existing image of the Grand Duchess as his model, viewing his own work as a distinctive portrait. He intended at first to paint the figure full-length but later changed the composition. In the picture can be seen a reflection of that same inspiration that seized Briullov when he was painting the interior of St. Isaac’s Cathedral. In the finish of its execution and the fineness of the drawing this work is on a level with his well-known works. The masterful rendering of the texture of the ermine-trimmed purple mantle, the gilt brocade dress and the jewels achieves the ultimate in perfection. The picture attracts the viewer as well by the loftiness of aspect, and the keen expectancy of the face and hands, qualities that are a distinguishing feature of Briullov’s best female portraits. (Atsarkina,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Briullov</span>, pp. 198–199). </p>
			<p class="Endnote-text-after-quote">St. Alexandra’s head is adorned with a diadem and an angel in the lower left corner supports her mantle as she ascends to Heaven. The gold and silver candlestick standing in front of the painting (see <a href="images_16.html#image452" target="_blank">Image 452</a>) was presented by the officers of the Cuirassier Regiment. As late as 1928, an inventory made of the furnishings in the oratory indicated that it was still standing before the painting. According to Baroness Frederiks, after their daughter’s death her parents never again gave a ball or held any celebration in the New (Alexander) Palace (Frederiks, “Iz vospominanii,” p.&#160;86).

The estate, called Ligovo, was acquired by the Count in l840 and enlarged in 1844 through his purchase of the bordering dachas of the English merchant N.A. Blando and of Privy Councilor M.P. Pozin. In 1845, the estate amounted to 2,700 desiatinas of land (1 d. = 2.7 acres), consisting of farmland, meadows, woods, marsh, buildings, gardens, conservatories, and a lake. The Count ran a model farm on his property. The main focus in planting was oats, hay, and potatoes. The dairy was new; in 1845, it had not yet been completed. Surplus milk was sold in the city. The buildings were constructed of brick made at Ligovo’s own factory, which was famous in the surrounding countryside. The roofs covering the majority of the farm buildings were made of a paper that was cheaper and lighter than iron, and very strong.

The wife referred to here is his second wife, Mary Ann Munden, spinster (1804 – 20 October / 1 November 1860), whom he married on 17/29 July 1827 in St. Petersburg. He was said in 1845 to have already been Count Kushelev’s steward for twenty-five years. The Russians called him Zakhar Zakharovich Maklotlin. Although he successfully oversaw the entire estate, his area of expertise was horsebreeding. The already well-off McLothlins were to profit even more on Count Kushelev’s death. In his last will and testament, dated 6 April (OS) 1853, Count Kushelev said his last wish was that his heirs should give one hundred thousand silver rubles to Maklotlin, “who has served me for thirty years and whom I respect and love as a friend.” His heirs agreed to carry out his wish. In the event that Count Kushelev’s wife should die at the same time as himself, he asked his heirs to take from the capital and monies that were in the form of securities and were to go to Maria Bogdanova the sum of an additional one hundred thousand silver rubles for Maklotlin (RGIA: Fond 971, op. 1, d. 155, fols. 10 r and v [see Note 509 above for document title]). It must be said, however, that although Count Kushelev’s heirs adhered to their uncle’s wishes concerning Maklotlin, Maria Grigorievna Kusheleva, and a sum of ten thousand silver rubles he asked to be distributed to servants and to the poor, they did not offer the Countess Kusheleva a share that satisfied her. She started a suit against them in June 1855, even appealing to Alexander II, but ultimately the matter was settled within the family in February 1856 (RGIA: Fond 971, op. 1, d. 155, fols. 10 r and v [see Note 509 above for document title]).

Anna Whistler or someone else corrected the date of this entry, changing it from what looks like 29 to 20. The information recorded in the entry, however, strongly supports the interpretation that she was writing it on Saturday, 26 September. If this is true, then her comment that the boys were placed in Monsieur Jourdan’s school “Monday before last” is not an error, as that Monday would have been September 14. The information that she drove out to the Field of Mars their first week of school, hoping to get a glimpse of them, also makes sense, as does the information about their first Saturday at home, which was 19 September. Moreover, she says she is recording the events of the last fortnight, which if calculated from 19 September does not make sense, but if calculated from 26 September, does. </span></p>

In his report for the second half of 1847 on private educational institutions in St. Petersburg under his supervision, the inspector, Collegiate Councilor (sixth grade) Aleksandr Del’, gave the following data about Monsieur Jean Jourdan (Ivan Zhurdan) and his school: he was a Court Councilor (seventh grade) and Cavalier, a French citizen, a Roman Catholic, and had been issued a certificate (no. 375) on 1/13 May 1826 to establish a boarding school for boys. According to the answers given to the questions on the official form, there were no deviations from the program as proposed to the authorities when establishing the school. The subjects, all successfully taught, were Orthodox religion, Roman Catholic religion, Protestant-Lutheran religion, history, geography, mathematics, Russian, French, German, drawing, dancing, and fencing, and all the teachers were certified to teach. The annual fees for full board were 450–600 silver rubles, for half-board 350 silver rubles. The fulfillment of Christian obligations was observed; the premises were extremely respectable; cleanliness, neatness, and discipline were in general very well observed. The pupils were maintained in a manner that corresponded to the fees paid for them, and the institution had all the necessary school equipment (RGIA: Fond 139, op. 1, d. 5188. <span lang="pl-PL">S Vedomostiami o chastnykh pansionakh i shkolakh v Sanktpeterburge za 2-uiu polovinu 1847 g. 3 Ian. 1848 – 27 Ian. 1848. </span>[With Information about private boarding schools and private schools in St. Petersburg for the second half of 1847. 3 January 1848 – 27 January 1848 (OS]), fol. 80 r). When James and Willie attended the school there were fifty pupils (Anna Whistler to Gen. J.G. Swift, St. Petersburg September 24, 1846, NYPL: Swift Papers). It was considered a first-class boarding school, equivalent to a Russian “gimnazium” (RGIA: Fond 139, op. 1, d. 4196.

He carried out his medical studies in Dorpat from 1811 to 1815. As a student, he worked in the Military Hospital in Riga, caring for the sick.

In 1820, he settled in St. Petersburg and was doctor at the prison until 1846. In 1835, he was appointed director of the newly founded Children’s Hospital.

Balch, at the request of several passengers, administered the Holy Communion in the cabin, to upward of sixty persons – many of whom received it there for the first time in their lives.” The storm reached its climax on Monday, the 21st, and abated around noon. On Tuesday morning, the passengers “assembled in the cabin to render an act of common prayer and thanksgiving.” At the conclusion of the service, it was resolved that a suitable monetary testimonial be made “to the captain, officers, and crew” and that “The Great Western Fund” be set up “for the relief of the families of those whose heads and supporters [were] lost at sea” (<span class="CharOverride-1">New York Evening Post</span>, October 1, 1846<span class="CharOverride-1">; </span>supplement to <span class="CharOverride-1">The Times</span> [London], October 19, 1846, pp. 8–9).

Anna Whistler’s interpretation is based on Hawker’s contemplations on the passage. For her, the symbolism of the passage is that Christ “has enabled me to feel it to be good to enter the cloud of affliction where His glorious presence becomes visible to the mourner who cannot bear the false glitter of this worlds joys.” She is referring to an unidentified edition of Hawker’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Evening Portion</span>.

The distinctness of the enlarged figures depends not only upon the goodness of the magnifying glass, but upon the clearness of the light yielded by the lamp … It may be purchased ready made of any optician … The lamp being lighted, and the room darkened, place the machine on the table, at some distance from the white wall or suspended sheet, and introduce into the slit … one of the sliders … with the figures inverted. If the movable tube … be then pushed in or drawn out, till the proper focus be obtained, the figures on the slider will be reflected on the wall, in their distinct colors and proportions, with the appearance of life itself and of any size, from six inches to seven feet, according to the distance of the lantern from the wall.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">Because of the sympathy felt by Peter the Great for Holland, the Dutch played an outstanding role in the early history of St. Petersburg. On the whole, they were masters of seafaring, marine officers, merchants, doctors, and builders. Beginning in 1708, they worshipped in the Lutheran church in the courtyard of Cornelius Cruys (1655–1727) and had their own pastor as of 1717. In November 1719, the Dutch bought the house in the Admiralty district belonging to Pierre Pusi and set up a church and school in it. On 6 April 1733, they acquired a one-story house on the corner of the Nevskii Prospekt and the Moika River that had previously belonged to the architect Jean-Baptiste Le Blond (1679–1719) and transferred their church to it. In 1736, this building burned down; it was not replaced until some five years later. In 1797, I. Kreber proposed building a magnificent cathedral, but his project was not acted upon. Another project offered in 1830 by R. Rigel also failed to be realized, because the architect refused to make required changes. It was not until 15 July 1831 that the building of a new cathedral with a façade decorated with a four-column portico, proposed by the Frenchman Paul Jacot (1798 –1860), was begun. </p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Round in plan and holding four hundred people, the church occupied the second floor and was decorated with paired Corinthian columns. On the pediment above them was the Latin inscription: <span class="CharOverride-1">Deo et servatori sacrum</span> (To God and Those Who Serve the Sacred), and in the tympanum the figures of two angels. Above the flat roof of the building rose a gently sloping cupola on top of which was a cross. The façades of the side wings of the church building with the semicircular tops of the first-floor windows formed an unbroken arcade in which shops and apartments were found. The interior was illuminated by a silver chandelier. The stucco work was by F. Balin, the murals by Vasiliev, and the organ by Master Friedrich. On 14 January 1834, the Prince of Orange and his son (the future Dutch kings Wilhelm II and Wilhelm III) were present at the consecration of the church.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Starting in the nineteenth century, the service was held in Dutch only in summer, after navigation commenced; in the remaining months of the year, it was in German, as the small congregation (of about 300) had become strongly Germanized (Shul’ts, <span class="CharOverride-1">Khramy Sankt-Peterburga</span>, p.&#160;260; Antonov and Kobak, <span class="CharOverride-1">Sviatyni Sankt-Peterburga</span>, vol. 3, pp. 264–265).</p>

In it, he mentioned having earlier written another letter to Whistler from Nyack, but did not say when he had written it. The letter of 4 November is the only extant Maxwell letter from Nyack at the N-YHS. Anna Whistler says nothing in her diary of the contents of this letter, received on 28 December 1846. This seems strange, because it contained a description of a visit made by Maxwell to Stonington, Connecticut, an event one would expect Anna Whistler to select for mention.

She was buffeted by the gale all of Thursday and was wrecked on the rocks at Fisher’s Island on Friday morning at 4 o’clock. There were 100–115 passengers on board. The steamer was equipped with “over a thousand life-preservers,” which they donned, some wearing two and some three, or the loss of life would have been greater.

Crop failures in Scotland continued into the 1850s, and famine relief programmes became semi-permanent operations. While the mortality rate was less than other Scottish famines in the 1690s, and 1780, the Highland potato famine eventually caused over 1.7 million people to leave Scotland during the period 1846–1852” (James Mitchell, NLS, to E.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovskii (Gaivazovskii) (1817 – 1900) was born in Feodosia in the Crimea, where he received his primary education at the Armenian parish school. The discovery of his talent for drawing resulted in his being taken by a benefactor to Simferopol, where he studied in the local high school from 1830 to 1833. Here his talent was discovered to be extraordinary. One of his drawings was submitted to S. Tonci in St. Petersburg and, in August 1833, Aivazovskii arrived to enrol at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts as a pensioner of the Cabinet of His Imperial Majesty. His talent, accompanied by an equally extraordinary capacity for hard work, resulted in a prodigious artistic productivity, which he himself later assessed at six thousand works, not including watercolors and drawings. He was assigned to the landscape-painting class of Professor M.N. Vorobiev (1789–1855). In 1835, he was appointed assistant to the French marinist, P. Tanneur (1795–1878), who was in the Imperial court service. Aivazovskii received the small silver medal and was put forward by A.N. Olenin (see <a href="images_11.html#image307" target="_blank">Image 307</a>), president of the Academy, to paint his first independent work: <span class="CharOverride-1">A View of the Sea in the Environs of St. Petersburg </span>(<span class="CharOverride-1">Vid na vzmor’e v okrestnostiakh Peterburga</span>), for which in 1836 he received the small gold medal. He achieved great acclaim in 1836 for five of his paintings presented at the Academy’s autumn exhibition. He came into conflict, however, with the authorities when Tanneur, accused by public opinion of jealousy, complained to Nicholas I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>) that Aivazovskii had shown five paintings instead of one without Tanneur’s knowledge. The intercession of Professor A.I. Sauerwied (1783– 1844), head of the battle-scene painting class, assuaged the anger of the emperor, who had ordered that Aivazovskii’s paintings be taken down. In April 1837, Aivazovskii was assigned to the Baltic Fleet and in summer of that year took part in the fleet’s maneuvers in the Gulf of Finland. Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich (see <a href="images_15.html#image436" target="_blank">Image 436</a>), second son of Nicholas I, and admiral of the fleet, remained his patron for many years. In September 1837, Aivazovskii received the large gold medal for three marine paintings shown at the Academy exhibition, making him eligible to be sent abroad to study. In 1838, six of his paintings were acquired by Imperial decree for the Academy. The Council of the Academy then decided to send him to Feodosia to devote himself to marine painting. In 1839, he took part in naval campaigns, where his friendship with several fleet commanders aided the development of the sea battle theme in his works. In 1839 as well, the Academy awarded him the title of artist fourteenth class. In July 1830, he was sent to Europe to study for four years. His exhibitions in major cities of Europe were greeted enthusiastically. His painting <span class="CharOverride-1">Chaos (Khaos)</span>, executed in 1841, was acquired by Pope Gregory XVI (today it is in a monastery on the island of San Lazzaro in Venice). In 1842, in Naples, he met J.M.W. Turner (1775–1851), who expressed his enchantment with Aivazovskii’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Bay of Naples on a Moonlit Night </span>(<span class="CharOverride-1">Neapolitanskii zaliv v lunnuiu noch’</span>) in a poem to him. In June–July 1844, Aivazovskii returned to St. Petersburg for a year, where he was elected an academician, appointed the official artist of the Main Naval Staff Headquarters, and received an Imperial commission to execute six paintings of ports and fortresses on the Baltic coast. In 1845, he accompanied Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich on an expedition under the command of Admiral F.P. Litke (1797–1882) to Turkey, Asia Minor, and the islands of the Greek archipelago. In 1845–1846, he took part in the maneuvers of the Black Sea Fleet. In 1846, in Feodosia, he executed two paintings and arranged a celebration of his tenth anniversary as an artist. In the summer of 1846, he was present at the maneuvers of the Baltic Fleet and executed paintings on episodes from the history of the Russian fleet. In February–March 1847, an exhibition was held in the Academy of the paintings exhibited in Feodosia, augmented by seven of his paintings lent from the Imperial collection. After this exhibition he was appointed professor at the Academy. In 1848, he executed a series of paintings depicting sea battles and arranged an acclaimed first Moscow exhibition. Nicholas I was unable to persuade him to live in St. Petersburg, and as of the autumn of 1848 Aivazovskii made his home in Feodosia. For the next fifty years, he had more than fifty solo exhibitions in St. Petersburg and many abroad, including in the United States, which he visited in 1892–1893. He died in Feodosia in 1900.

The full title of this large painting (223 cm x 335 cm) is <span class="CharOverride-1">Peter I at Krasnaia Gorka Lighting a Bonfire on the Shore as a Beacon to his Foundering Ships</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Petr I pri Krasnoi gorke, zazhigaiushchii kostyor dlia podachi signala gibnushchim svoim sudam</span>). Executed in 1846, its subject was the 31st of August (OS) 1714, when the Baltic Fleet encountered a heavy storm in the Gulf of Finland. On that night, when his ships were threatened with destruction, Peter the Great went ashore in a ship’s boat and ordered a bonfire to be lit as a beacon for them. The painting depicts the terrifying storm, dark clouds and flashes of lightning illuminating the foundering ships. Peter the Great is in the foreground, standing on the rocky shore, facing the ships (N.S. Barsamov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovskii 1817–1900</span> [Moscow: Iskusstvo, 1962], pp. 67, 180, 195; N.S.

His back is to the bonfire. With his left hand he makes a staying gesture to the people around the bonfire. One holds brushwood to place on the bonfire, another holds a lit torch aloft, a third awaits the signal to light his torch.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">The Order of St. Anne (see <a href="images_9.html#image252" target="_blank">Image 252</a>) was founded in 1735 by Duke Karl-Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp in honor of his recently deceased wife, Anna Petrovna, Peter the Great’s daughter. It came to be part of the system of Russian orders in 1797 on the day Paul I (see <a href="images_15.html#image417" target="_blank">Image 417</a>) was crowned emperor. The motto of the order was “To Those Who Love Justice, Piety and Faith,” and the order was awarded for “great deeds in civil service and labors for the public benefit.” The Order of St. Anne (2nd class) was a red enameled four-armed cross with a gold border and azure ornamentation between the arms of the cross. In a central medallion was “a painted image of St. Anne in a landscape.” The second-class order was worn around the neck on a red ribbon with a yellow stripe running down each side of it but leaving a red edge. As of 1829, an Imperial crown was added to the first and second class of the order and “was attached to the upper arm of the cross” (Nancy Eickel, ed., <span class="CharOverride-1">Moscow: Treasures and Traditions</span> [Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service; Seattle and London: University of Washington Press, 1990], pp. 141, 258; Fedosiuk, <span class="CharOverride-1">Chto neponiatno u klassikov</span>, pp. 136–137; V.A.

The celebration Anna Whistler mentions was an annual pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Nicholas.

The opening of the sixteen-mile section of railway from St. Petersburg to Kolpino “was set to coincide with this religious festival” (Haywood, p.&#160;277).

At the end is a window of exquisite beauty … the painted glass represents embroidery … In one corner of this Transept is the entrance to the Chapter House … an octagon of 63 feet in diameter, the height to the middle knot of the roof is 67 ft. 10 inches, without the interruption of a single pillar, being entirely dependent for support on a pin geometrically placed in the centre. The outside, however, is strengthened by eight buttresses … Below the windows are 44 stalls for the canons who composed the chapter … Here you have figures of men and beasts in the most antic postures; … the Great Western Aisle or Nave, is the most spacious of any church in Europe, except St. Peter’s, at Rome … It is divided into three aisles, the pillars forming eight equal arches; the foliage in the capitals exhibit a great variety of design, no one capital having the same foliage around … an open gallery runs on both sides of the nave, intended for spectators to view the grand ceremonies of the Romish church … The view of the interior of this stupendous pile is inconceivably magnificent … Upward, the eye is dazzled with the immensity of space; in front, is a vista of 524 feet in length, and at the extremity the noble east window … The West window is … a perfect specimen of the leaf tracery that marks the style of the 14th century … But the glory of the whole is <span class="CharOverride-1">the Great East Window</span> … 75 ft. high, and 30 feet 9 inches broad … Each pane of glass is nearly a yard square; the figures are in general from 2 feet 2 inches to 2 feet 4 inches high, the heads beautifully drawn. A stone gallery runs across dividing the window into two parts. The view from this elevation is inconceivably grand; the whole interior of the church, a vista of more than 500 feet is before you, with the beautiful west window at the termination … The approaches to the minster have latterly been much improved by the removal of a number of old houses which stood so near the church as to preclude all view of the building.

The Yorkshire Museum opened on 2 February 1830 and housed not only geological, mineral and zoological collections, but “a variety of fragments of beautiful sculpture from the adjoining ruins.” The “highly cultivated garden” Anna Whistler refers to, in the midst of which the ruins were located, was the museum’s gardens. “The grounds [were] entered through Museum-street, through a handsome gateway of the Doric order” and were easily accessible from their hotel on the corner of Museum and Blake Streets (<span class="CharOverride-1">Stranger’s Guide</span> 1846, pp. 34, 35).</p>

			<p class="Endnote-text4">As described by Granville, Scarborough had only since the late 1820s been making improvements in its offerings. Granville made reference to the “New Spa,” “which, like a turrented castle, is strongly seated on a sea wall nigh the shore, at the foot of [a] high bank covered with green, beneath Olive Mount.” Inside were “two mineral springs,” which “were formerly very insufficiently protected by a mean-looking building, from the inroads of the sea.” “Between this spot, and another equally high ground opposite, beyond which stand the two springs …, [is] a chasm four hundred feet wide … with a depth of nearly eighty feet.” Cliff Bridge has been built across the chasm, “resting upon light iron arches, and supported by three square stone insulated piers seventy feet high; … a lofty, open, iron railing serves as a protecting parapet along each of its sides.” “On the broad sands of [the] shore [below,] the Scarborough races are held,” when the tide recedes; and the bridge, from which the public can watch the races, has been called “the grandest <span class="CharOverride-1">stand</span> of any race-ground in the world.” “In a small, sunken court of the castellated [Gothic] building, surrounded by stone walls, are the lion-mouthed spouts, known as the ‘North and South Wells or Spas’. [They are] placed at some little distance from each other, from which the mineral water is continually pouring.”</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">If one stands with one’s back “turned to the sea and its sweeping bays, … the eye [is directed] to the toll-gate … at the furthest extremity of the bridge [, where] the circular platform of ‘the Cliff’ expands. backed by its oblong square, formed of neat dwelling-houses.” On the left, one sees “the long side and square tower of Christchurch,” a recently constructed buliding. Also visible is “the beginning of a projected grand crescent,” begun in 1833, which, when completed, “will mask an unsightly range of stables erected on the same ridge.” The Crescent was completed in 1857, but not according to the plan originally projected.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">“Descending towards the sloping ravine at the bottom of which runs the road that passes under the bridge, to reach the Strand, the ridge … terminates in a green knoll,” where the Scarborough Museum, “a rotunda of Roman-Doric structure,” is located. It is constructed of Hackness Stone, considered both beautiful and valuable because “in the quarry it is very soft, easily chiselled, and readily fashioned into architectural decoration; but … soon becomes hard [and durable] on exposure to the air.” The museum belongs to the Scarborough Philosophical Society. Built “for the display of British geological specimens … the principal room, … thirty-five feet high, and lighted from an aperture in the dome, … contains sloping shelves, in which are displayed fossil specimens, such as corals; recent shells, and birds and animals.” “[Every] part of the museum can be seen at once,” because of this arrangement.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">If one’s “eye now returns to the centre of the Cliff Bridge, … to the right or north side,” one sees “[a] bold line of cliffs … emerg[ing] from within the opening of Scarborough harbour, and … project[ing] into the sea.” The summit of this line of cliffs “rises higher the farther it stands out, until upon its loftiest point, … more than three hundred feet above the highest tide, it exhibits the once famed, but now ruinous castle, within the surrounding walls of which lie concealed nineteen acres of smiling green land.” One will see the parish “church of St. Mary, with its square tower … farther inland, add[ing] to the effect of this picture by its contrast with the remains of the embattled walls of the castle; beyond which, the outline, gradually descending to the horizon, terminates at some distance with the piers of Scarborough harbour.”</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">“Here [will be found] the many and heavy clusters of red brick dwellings of the humbler classes, which are thickly huddled together right and left of the opening of the harbour, spread some way inland, and form the primitive and old town of Scarborough.”</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Granville then goes on to praise the cold and warm baths; the strand with its walkers and equestrians in the early morning; the bathing-machines “on their broad wheels”; the outstanding fish to be had for dinner; the lack of dancing, sociability, and theater, but the availability of inland and water excursions, and angling. The <span class="CharOverride-1">Gazette</span> shows a predominance of farmer aristocracy “from the East and West ridings” until August, replaced at that point by “those of a superior class.” Also lauded is the availability of jet, quarried at Whitby and cut into ornaments in Scarborough.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Finally, Granville praises the climate of Scarborough. Despite “its exposure on the east coast, … winds in an easterly direction” do not last longer here than in other areas. Scarborough is sheltered by hills that make “the winters remarkably mild,” and it is “open to the whole day’s sun” (Granville, <span class="CharOverride-1">Spas of England, </span>vol. 1, <span class="CharOverride-1">Northern Spas</span>, pp. 150, 157, 158–159, 160, 162, 175, 176–177, 179–181, 183–192).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">In 1841, the population of Scarborough was about 9500; in 1851, about 12,000 (Arthur Rowntree, ed., <span class="CharOverride-1">The History of Scarborough</span> [London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1931], p.&#160;281). “Houses were built on the east side of St. Nicholas Cliff in the [eighteen] forties with gardens on the undercliff” (Rowntree, p.&#160;286–287); this is where Mrs. Ropes and Anna Whistler and their children were staying. “The earliest recorded display of fireworks took place [there] in 1844” (Rowntree, p.&#160;275).

The Servants’ School, established in 1820 at Tunstall by Rev. William Carus-Wilson, MA (1791–1859) and permanently established in 1838 at Casterton, educated poor girls to be servants and teachers. In 1823, Mr. Carus-Wilson also established at Cowan Bridge near Tunstall the Clergy Daughters’ School, for the education at low cost of the daughters of poor clergy, most of whom, “on leaving the school, are provided for as governesses in respectable families.” The school was later transferred to Casterton. The Preparatory Clergy Daughters’ School was established in 1837, chiefly for the education of orphan children, who later entered the Clergy Daughters’ School. A National School was established about 1841.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Of these schools, the Clergy Daughters’ School achieved the greatest fame. Charlotte Brontë and her sisters Maria, Elizabeth, and Emily were enrolled there in 1824, the year it opened. In 1825, Maria and Elizabeth were sent home ill and died shortly thereafter: Maria of consumption, Elizabeth of typhoid fever. The school sent Charlotte and Emily away. Charlotte Brontë wrote disparagingly of these early days of the school and of Mr. Carus-Wilson in <span class="CharOverride-1">Jane Eyre </span>(1847), where the Clergy Daughters’ School became the Lowood School, Mr. Carus-Wilson became Mr. Brocklehurst, her sister Maria became Helen Burns, and Kirkby Lonsdale became Lowton. This detraction brought forth the defense of the school by other former pupils, resulting in a public controversy (Mannex, <span class="CharOverride-1">Westmorland</span>, p.&#160;353; H.

Because his health showed signs of being undermined by consumption, he was sent to the south of Europe to recover. “The pattern [of the burials he conducted] suggests that from the start Cameron needed or used the assistance of others (up to his last entry, he did 20 out of 75 funerals …), fell ill in 1847, recovered enough to do a stint of duty in mid-1848 (and one funeral in October) but nothing thereafter” (Rev. Michael Ainsworth, St. Mark’s Worsley, to E. Harden, 19 July 2001). We know little of the period after 1848, except that he married on 24 April 1851 Marcia Sarah Elizabeth Burrell (c. 1824 – 22 October 1889), with whom he had at least five children. From 1853 to 1856, he was the incumbent of the donative of Oxhey, Watford, Hertfordshire, and perpetual curate of Christ Church Longlane, Trusley, Derbyshire from 1860 until his death the following year. He died during divine service in Heckingham Church, Lincolnshire. He authored <span class="CharOverride-1">The Tyrrany of Popery by an Eye Witness as Seen in Italy </span>(1853) and edited <span class="CharOverride-1">The Infallible Way to Contentment</span> (1849) and <span class="CharOverride-1">The British Workman </span>(1855–62), as well as writing a life of his mother, published in the year of his death (Boase, <span class="CharOverride-1">Modern English Biography</span>, vol. 1, pp. 522, 524; Rev. Michael Ainsworth, St. Mark’s Worsley, to E. Harden, 9 March 2000, 19 July 2001; IGI; 1861 Census).

The second edition, published by his brother, is <span class="CharOverride-1">The Life of Mrs. Cameron</span>, revised and edited by Rev. George Thomas Cameron M.A. (London: Houston and Sons, 1873).

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-843"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-843-backlink">843</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Cameron’s aunt was the famous author of children’s literature, Mary Martha (Butt) Sherwood (Stanford, Worcestershire 6 May 1775 – Twickenham 20 September 1851), elder daughter and second child of Rev. George (Lichfield 26 December 1741 – no earlier than 29 September 1795) and Martha (Sherwood) Butt (c. 1751 – 20 March 1817). Her father, rector of Stanford and Clifton-on-Teme, was appointed in 1784 “one of the Chaplains in Ordinary to his Majesty George the Third” (Sophia Kelly, ed., <span class="CharOverride-1">The Life of Mrs. Sherwood, Chiefly Autobiographical, with Extracts from Mr. Sherwoods Journal during his Imprisonment in France &amp; Residence in India</span> [London: Darton, 1857], p.&#160;43). She was brought up by remarkable parents who were too simple and good to understand “life as it really is” (Kelly, p.&#160;116). Concerning her childhood, she said her “early impressions were most beautiful as regarded natural things, and classical as regarded intellectual things” (Kelly, p.&#160;17). She was taught Latin by her mother, who learned the language specifically to teach it to her. She also learned Greek and had access to several important libraries belonging to her father and to neighbors. In 1788, her father was further presented with the Vicarage of Kidderminster, and the family moved from their idyllic country life to the city. Eventually they were able to return to Stanford. After her father’s death, the family moved to Bridgenorth. Here, Mary and Lucy Butt took up “Sunday School work on the lines laid down by Hannah More” (M. Nancy Cutt, <span class="CharOverride-1">Mrs. Sherwood and her Books for Children</span> [London: Oxford University Press, 1974], p.&#160;2). It was always “a matter of course” and “a matter of instinct” to her that she was to be a writer (Kelly, <span class="CharOverride-1">Life of Mrs. Sherwood</span>, p.&#160;118). At nineteen, her career was launched, when she published, anonymously and against her will, by subscription, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Traditions</span>, the proceeds from which were used to benefit a family friend in financial straits. In 1803, she married her first cousin, Henry Sherwood (c. 1776 – 6 December 1849), of the 53rd Foot Regiment, then serving in England. In April 1805, they departed with the regiment for India, leaving their first child, born in 1804, with Mrs. Sherwood’s mother. “During [the] … five-month voyage,” Mrs. Sherwood’s “well-developed Evangelical urge crystallized” (Cutt, <span class="CharOverride-1">Mrs. Sherwood</span>, p.&#160;2), and by the time she arrived in India “she had … decided that her appointed work lay in the religious education of the young and of the heathen” (Cutt, p.&#160;3). Her Evangelical doctrine of this period is characterized as “unyielding” (Cutt, p.&#160;4), and her writing of an “intensity that sets it above most of the work of the more tranquil days” after their return home (Cutt, p.&#160;4). On returning from India in 1816, with five children of their own and two adopted orphans to raise, they settled in Wick. Mrs. Sherwood opened “a small select boarding-school for girls” (Cutt, p.&#160;4), which she ran from 1818 to 1830. </span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">On giving up the school, she toured the Continent with her family, returning to England in 1832 and devoting herself “to novel writing and story-telling” almost until her death (Cutt, p.&#160;4). They lived first in Worcester. In this period, Mrs. Sherwood lost a brother and two daughters, but her son, a clergyman, married and lived near the Sherwoods, while her youngest daughter married and lived with the Sherwoods. In 1849, her son-in-law and husband died, and she and her widowed daughter moved to Twickenham, where Mrs. Sherwood died in 1851. Mrs. Sherwood produced over a period of some fifty years more than four hundred works, including “books, tales, tracts, texts, magazines, articles in periodicals, chapbooks, and Sunday school rewards” (Cutt, p.&#160;ix). The theories of Evangelical doctrine “diffused by [her] writings,” while not originated by her, “dominated education for half a century; and governed missionary activity abroad” (Cutt, p.&#160;ix). When Anna Whistler wrote of Mrs. Sherwood, the latter was famous and rich, and her career was chiefly behind her; she would live only some four years more. There is no indication in the diaries that Anna Whistler had read Mrs. Sherwood’s works growing up, but according to her step-niece, Emma Palmer, Emma, James and Willie read them on Sundays when other books were forbidden (McDiarmid, <span class="CharOverride-1">Whistler’s Mother</span>, p.&#160;155).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The works consulted to prepare this biography of Mrs. Sherwood are: Kelly, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Life of Mrs. Sherwood</span>; F.J. Harvey Darton, ed.,<span class="CharOverride-1"> The Life and Times of Mrs. Sherwood (1775 – 1851)</span> <span class="CharOverride-1">from the Diaries of Captain and Mrs. Sherwood</span> (London: Wells Gardner, Darton, 1910); Cutt, <span class="CharOverride-1">Mrs. Sherwood</span>; and Naomi Royce Smith,<span class="CharOverride-1"> The State of Mind of Mrs. Sherwood</span> (London: Macmillan, 1946). </p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-844"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-844-backlink">844</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Mrs. Sherwood is mentioned in the previous sentence, “she” in the next sentence may seem to refer to her. This identification is supported by the fact that Mrs. Sherwood cared for orphaned girls. Her first two children born in India died in infancy. She then began to accept into her care orphaned white girls. They were either the daughters of widowed British soldiers or they had lost both parents. A number of these girls were then adopted by British families. The Sherwoods themselves adopted two girls: Sally Pownal and Mary Parsons, who returned with them permanently to England in 1816, later marrying and settling near them. But neither Mrs. Sherwood’s biography by her daughter, Sophia Kelly, nor the biography by Darton, mentions a wealthy orphan girl shipwrecked on her way home from India and taken in by Mrs. Sherwood. It therefore makes more sense to interpret “she” as a reference to Lady Ellesmere. It then becomes plausible that the wealthy orphan is living in Worsley, and that the ladies of the Ellesmere family will serve as good examples of charity to her (Kelly, <span class="CharOverride-1">Life of Mrs. Sherwood</span>, pp. 311, 325–326, 330, 376, 409, 432, 468, 469–470, 488, 494, 496, 504, 514, 545, 550, 551; Darton,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Mrs. Sherwood</span>, pp. 438, 460).

Apparently, some of the cotton masters, or cotton Lords, of Preston, had been to see John Winstanley, probably on legal matters. “Throughout much of the nineteenth century the cotton industry was the main driving force of economic growth in Preston” (p. 199). “[D]irectly related to the growth of textiles,” the population of Preston increased “from 11,887 people in 1801 to 69,361 in 1851” (p. 183). In the 1830s and 1840s the expansion reached “40 per cent per decade” (p. 183). “In the 1840s alone, accommodation for an additional 18,500 people had to be found,” and “grossly inadequate housing was hastily thrown up … [for] the mill workers” (p. 183). Living conditions were horrendous (pp. 183–185). “Preston’s … mill wages were generally among the lowest in the county, at least in the first half of the nineteenth century. Since the … rates of pay in neighbouring towns reflected the various local conditions it was generally believed that an advance in wages paid in Preston would push up the rates in the rest of the industry. Accordingly, Preston became a great battleground, with both sides receiving aid and support from the adjacent towns … In the first half of the … century control of the … industry lay very much in the hands of the cotton masters and their families” (p. 204). “By 1836 the town had 42 mills employing perhaps one fifth of its population. The 1830s and ‘40s were perhaps the industry’s most significant period of expansion in Preston … perhaps best exemplified by the erection of Swainson and Birley’s ‘Big Factory’  …, while in 1845 William Ainsworth announced the construction of ‘the largest power-loom weaving shed in the world’” (p. 199). But the late 1830s and early 1840s were also a period of economic depression (p. 199). It was very severe in 1842 (p. 214). Two attempts by the Chartists to present their Charter petitition to ameliorate the situation (in 1839 and 1842) were “thrown out by Parliament” (p. 214). There were strikes and riots. “Preston became … <span class="CharOverride-1">the</span> classic mill town” (p. 182). “Charles Dickens used contemporary accounts of the town during the Great Lockout [1853–4] as the background for … <span class="CharOverride-1">Hard Times</span>. His description of ‘Coketown’ is thus loosely based on Preston” (p. 223). Anna Whistler did not give an opinion of the unrest. She was entertained by the Swainsons and met members of the Ainsworth family at the Winstanleys’ home (see <a href="images_17.html#image470" target="_blank">Images 470–473</a>).</span></p>

Under Edward the Confessor, an abbey was raised upon the site of the ruined monastic building. The ground plan, as usual, bore the form of the cross; … It [became] the place for the inauguration of the English monarchs, and William the Conqueror was crowned here … in 1066. Henry III. enlarged the abbey, and the building continued in the state in which he left it until Henry VII. added a chapel, built in the florid Gothic style, … the most splendid structure of the age, … it was enjoined that the remains of royalty alone should be interred within its walls. During the reign of Henry VIII., the abbey was considerably defaced, but on the surrender of its revenues, Henry raised Westminster to the dignity of a city, and its abbey was constituted a cathedral. It was, however, afterwards reunited to London in 1550. Westminster Abbey, during the reign of William and Mary, was thoroughly repaired, and the towers added at the western entrance, under the direction of the celebrated Sir Christopher Wren. …</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The length of the abbey is 416 feet; breadth at the transept, 203 feet; nave, 102 feet; height of the west towers, 225 feet. The exterior measurement, including Henry VII.’s Chapel, is 530 feet.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">On entering at the great western door between the towers, the magnificence of the abbey at once strikes the beholder with reverential awe: nearly the whole of the interior appears in grand masses of towering Gothic columns of grey marble, connecting the pavement with the roof, and separating the nave from the side aisles. A screen divides the nave from the choir, which is surmounted by a noble organ, while beyond, the eye soars amid graceful columns, tracery, and decorated windows, to the summit of the eastern arch that overlooks the adjacent chapels. The walls on either side display a great profusion of sepulchral monuments …</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Above the line of tombs there are chambers and galleries, once occupied by nuns. … The northern window is richly ornamented with stained glass, representing the Holy Scriptures surrounded by a band of cherubim, in the centre; on the sides, the Saviour, the Evangelists, and Apostles, appear in recumbent attitudes. From this window proceeds a calm ray of light, very advantageous to the display of the beautiful sculpture on which it falls. There are numerous tombs and monuments of noble persons, exquisitely imagined and executed, in emblematical groups or in faithful portraiture …</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The Chapel of Edward the Confessor is at the eastern end of the choir, and contains the shrine of St. Edward … Here also is the coronation-chair, under which is placed the celebrated stone brought from Scone in Scotland by Edward I., in 1297. The Chapel of Henry VII. is also at the eastern end of Westminster Abbey; and among the ashes of many whose brows were decorated with diadems, are those of Mary and Elizabeth. The ascent to this splendid piece of Gothic art, which has been extolled as the wonder of the world, is by steps of black marble beneath a stately portico. The entrance gates display workmanship of extraordinary richness in brass. The effect produced on entering this chapel is solemn and elevating: the lofty ceiling is wrought in stone into an astonishing variety of figures and devices; the stalls are of oak, having the deep tone of age, with Gothic canopies, all elaborately carved. Here are installed the knights of the most honourable the Order of the Bath … The pavement is composed of black and white marble, beneath which is the royal vault. The magnificent tomb of Henry VII. and Elizabeth his queen, stands in the body of this chapel in a curious chantry of cast brass, most admirably executed, and interspersed with effigies, armorial bearings, and devices, alluding to the union of the red and white roses.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Westminster Abbey is a collegiate church, with a dean and chapter, who possess a considerable authority over the adjoining district. The abbey may be considered as subdivided into nine chapels; but in the present day divine service is performed only in a space enclosed with wood, near the eastern extremity of the building. It takes place daily at ten in the morning and three in the afternoon, though sometimes none are present but the officials. The public worship of the parish is conducted in the adjacent church of St. Margaret.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The abbey is usually entered by a side door at Poet’s corner, which is nearly opposite the House of Lords. Here strangers will find admittance daily, and be conducted through the building on payment of certain fees” (<span class="CharOverride-1">Chambers’s Information</span> 1842, p.&#160;217).</p>

The main design of this large structure is to exhibit a kind of panoramic view of London, and this is accomplished with surprising fidelity and effect.

[London: printed by the author, 1848], p.&#160;194). The building, “commenced in 1824, and completed in 1827,” is made of “brick, faced with cement, tinted to imitate stone. The interior is judiciously disposed into a saloon, where works of art are exhibited … The gardens surrounding the Colosseum comprise conservatories, waterfalls, fountains, a Swiss cottage, a marine cave and grotto, all of beautiful construction” (Mogg, p.&#160;194).

A church was planted here four hundred years before the Norman Conquest, and under various shapes and extensions, it remained till destroyed by the great fire in London, in 1666. An entirely new edifice was then erected in its stead, the important work being committed to Sir Christopher Wren. It is built in the form of a Greek cross, and measures 514 feet in length, 286 in breadth, and 370 in height, to the topmost pinnacle. Outwardly, the walls, which have a dark sooty appearance, except where bleached with the rains, exhibit a double range of windows. There are three porticoes at as many entrances, on the north, west, and south. That on the west is the principal, with twelve lofty Corinthian pillars below, and the angles above crowned with handsome bell towers, the size of ordinary church towers or steeples. But this entrance, which fronts the street called Ludgate Hill, is apparently disused, and the common entrance is by the north portico and flight of steps. On entering, the impression produced by the vastness of the internal space is very great … The only objects designed to please in detail are the statues and sepulchral monuments ranged along the sides of the aisles. The revenues of St. Paul’s are considerable, and support several prebendaries and other functionaries, the institution being a collegiate church. Prayers are read every morning and afternoon. Through some fine open screenwork, a view is obtained of the place where the usual services are performed, and which is highly decorated with dark oaken carved work … [One] may mount by means of stairs and ladders to the top of the cupola; … the extensive view … comprehends the whole of London, with the country beyond its outskirts, and the Thames rolling placidly in its winding course through the dense mass of houses … The clock-work and great bell … always attract the notice of visiters. The pendulum measures fourteen feet in length, while the mass at its extremity is one hundredweight. The great bell, which is only rung when a member of the royal family dies, is placed in the southern turret above the western portico, and weighs four and a half tons, and is ten feet in diameter. The fine deep tones of this mighty bell, on which the hours are struck, sweep solemnly in a quiet evening across the metropolis, and are heard distinctly … several miles distant. In the immediate vicinity of St. Paul’s, the town has a retired cloistered appearance, the names of the very streets and lanes giving token of their former connexion with the religious structure and its clerical attendants. The enclosed churchyard is surrounded by a street, not of the broadest dimensions, closely hemmed in with houses, now chiefly dedicated to trade, the lower storeys being, as usual, shops. An open arched passage on the south side of the churchyard leads to Doctors’ Commons, or the offices connected with the ecclesiastical courts. St. Paul’s is open each week day from 9 to 11, and from 3 to 4 ; and on Sunday from 10 to 12, and from 3 to 5. An authorized tariff of fees is exhibited at the door (<span class="CharOverride-1">Chambers’s Information</span> 1842, p.&#160;214–215).</span></p>

The most ancient of these open grounds is <span class="CharOverride-1">St. James’s Park</span>, so called from St. James’s Palace, which partly bounds it on the north. Originally these grounds were a marshy waste, which was drained and otherwise improved by Henry VIII., who also took down an ancient hospital dedicated to St. James, and built on its site the palace now called St. James’s. Charles II. improved the grounds by planting the avenues of lime-trees on the north and south sides of the park, and forming the Mall, which was a hollowed, smooth, graveled space, half a mile long, skirted with a wooden border, for playing at balls. The southern avenue was appropriated to aviaries: hence it derived the appellation Birdcage Walk. The centre of the park was occupied by canals and ponds for acquatic birds. William III. threw the park open to the public for their recreation. It is nearly a mile and a half in circumference, and the avenues form delightful shady promenades. In the centre is a fine piece of water, interspersed with islands, and covered with swans and various water-fowl. On each side are spacious lawns, dotted with lofty trees and flowering shrubs. The lawns are separated from the avenues by iron railings, and at each entrance is a keeper’s lodge. There are seven or eight entrances to the park, the king’s guard doing duty at each, day and night. At the east side of St. James’s Park is a large graveled space called the Parade, on which, about ten o’clock every morning, the body-guards required for the day are mustered – about seven or eight hundred men; and here the regimental bands perform every morning between ten and eleven oclock … north from the parade, is a broad flight of steps, giving entrance to the park from Waterloo Place, constructed by order of William IV.; these steps are surmounted by a lofty column, commemorative of the late Duke of York, which occupies the spot where lately stood Carlton Palace, the favourite residence of George IV. while Prince Regent. The buildings near this, which overlook the park, are lofty and elegant. Farther along the Mall, or avenue, is St. James’s Palace, an inelegant brick structure, having its front toward Pall-Mall … This palace is used only occasionally by the queen, the principal royal residence being now <span class="CharOverride-1">Buckingham Palace</span> [see <a href="images_17.html#image476" target="_blank">Image 476</a>]” (<span class="CharOverride-1">Chambers’s Information</span> 1842, p.&#160;218). </span></p>

Delahay Street and Duke Street were connected; Delahay became Duke at the bend in the road. There was a chapel in Duke Street called Duke Street Chapel that was just past the bend in the road. Chapel Place was probably adjacent to the Duke Street Chapel. Delahay Street was occupied predominantly by engineers, including T.M. Smith, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806 –1859) lived on Duke Street. These streets no longer exist. See Stevenson and Smith in <a href="40_stevenson.html">Appendix&#160;E</a>.</p>

The medical graduates card file at Edinburgh University Library has a card for him, with a biographical note, which says: “LRCP London 1833. Assistant Physician London Fever Hospital. Visited St. Petersburg 1848 and became Member of Imperial College of Physicians there. Practised later again in London. Published various contributions.” As he was “[n]ot in Edinburgh list,” it was conjectured that he was “possibly same as James Crawford M.D. Ed. 1820, with thesis <span class="CharOverride-1">De Ictero</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Concerning Jaundice</span>]” (Jo Currie, Edinburgh, to E. Harden, 22 November 1993). The <span class="CharOverride-1">National Probate Calendar </span>(UK) for 1880 shows, however, that he was “John, otherwise Adair,” Crawford. He did not stay long in St. Petersburg, leaving sometime in the summer of 1848. In that same year, he published his <span class="CharOverride-1">Observations on the Asiatic Cholera, during a Residence in St. Petersburg in 1848, and on Its Prevention and Cure; with an Account of the Sanitary Regulations Proposed to Be Adopted against the Spreading of the Disease in This Country</span>, Metropolitan Sanitary Commission (London: W. Clowes &amp; Son for Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, 1848). The Introduction is dated “August 31, 1848,” and gives his address as “3, St. James’ Street, Pall Mall” (see also the <span class="CharOverride-1">London and Provincial Medical Directory, 1851</span> [London: John Churchill, 1851] [hereafter, <span class="CharOverride-1">London and Provincial Medical Directory</span> and the year], pp. 26, 60). The publication was only twenty-four pages long, as his chief object was “to urge upon the attention of the public” that “cholera is almost invariably preceded by premonitory symptoms of derangement in the function of the digestive organs,” chiefly by diarrhea. If proper remedies are used “to check these premonitory symptoms on their first appearance …, the progress of the disease is generally arrested, and the development of its dangerous and unmanageable symptoms prevented.” He left it for physicians resident in St. Petersburg to undertake a “full account of the course of the epidemic” there, and praised them for the “indefatigable zeal and courage” they displayed at great personal peril (Crawford, Introduction, <span class="CharOverride-1">Asiatic Cholera</span>, p.&#160;3). He was also the author of “Inflammation of the Brain,” and the article “Inflammation” in <span class="CharOverride-1">The Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine</span> (London: Sherwood, Gilbert &amp; Piper, 1833–1835, pp. 700–815) (<span class="CharOverride-1">London and Provincial Medical Directory 1851</span>, p.&#160;60). At the time of his death, he was living at 18 Montague Street at Russell Square (<span class="CharOverride-1">London and Provincial Medical Directory 1880</span>, p.&#160;1303). His personal estate was under one thousand pounds (<span class="CharOverride-1">National Probate Calendar</span> (UK), 1879).

Charles Wood also placed his son, William Nicholson Wood, in the school as a boarder. The Smiths, however, were found to be poorly prepared to carry out their duties as teachers. On 6 February 1848, Rev. Smith tendered his and his wife’s resignation to the school’s Committee. It was accepted on condition that they remain in their posts until 26 June 1848. As their replacements, the Committee invited a male and female teacher from England who were fully qualified and had presented excellent testimonials of their ability.

When Major Whistler died, Mr. Biber, no longer in their employ, sent a letter of condolence to Anna Whistler, in which “he spoke of the great affliction of his brother at the loss of his first patron” (William Whistler to James Whistler, St. Petersburg 10th May 1849, GUL: Whistler Collection, W978). This may mean that Mr. Biber’s brother was an artist (as well as a teacher of French) and had received his first commission from Major Whistler. When Major Whistler was dying, he bequeathed a portrait of himself to Colonel Pavel Mel’nikov and, as no other portrait of him executed in Russia is extant or mentioned in any of the archival materials I have consulted, it was probably this portrait.

			<p class="Endnote-text6">Thorvaldsen’s brilliant career began with his sculpture from classical mythology (1803) of Jason and the Golden Fleece that “attracted the attention of the Italian sculptor Antonio Canova.” Among his other famous sculptures are the “Alexander Frieze of 1812 in the Palazzo del Quirinale, Rome, modeled … in anticipation of a visit by Napoleon”; the marble monument (1823–1831) for the tomb of Pope Pius VII in St. Peter’s Cathedral in Rome; the carving in natural rock of a dying lion (1819), located in a small park in Lucerne, Switzerland, “commemorat[ing] the hundreds of Swiss Guards … massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution”; the bronze equestrian statue (1817–1832) in Warsaw of Józef Poniatowski (1763–1813), a Polish revolutionary, who became a marshal of France; and the marble sculpture of the Three Graces and Cupid (1821) in Copenhagen. Thorvaldsen created in all more than five hundred and fifty sculptures, sculptural reliefs, and portrait busts. He did not return permanently to Denmark until 1838, where he was granted “freedom of the city.”</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text6">The desire of the citizens of Copenhagen to build in honor of Thorvaldsen a museum (see <a href="images_18.html#image479" target="_blank">Image 479</a>) to house his “original models of the sculptures he created for numerous European countries” and for his native land, as well as his “drawings and sketches for sculptures and reliefs … and his extensive collection of [contemporary] paintings, and art works and [artifacts] from Greek, Roman and Egyptian antiquity” received the cooperation of the artist, who had donated his art collection “to the Danish people in 1830” and declared his wish also to be buried in the museum.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text6">Although the commission to design the museum was given to the architect Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll (1800–1856), ultimately the old Royal Coach House, located near Christiansborg Palace in the center of Copenhagen, was renovated for the purpose. It is two stories high and has a basement consisting of small rooms, each containing a single piece of sculpture; the Christ Hall and entrance hall were new.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text6">The museum was in the process of construction from 1839 to 1848. Unfortunately, Thorvaldsen suffered a heart attack while attending a performance in the Royal Danish Theater on the evening of 23 March 1844 and died. As the museum was unfinished, his coffin was placed in a chapel in Vor Frue Kirke. On 6 September 1848, it was transferred to the burial chamber in the courtyard of the Thorvaldsen Museum, a few days before the museum’s official opening on 18 September 1848. His works can be found in major international museums such as the Louvre in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg (“<a href="https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMJ3QM_Thorvaldsen_Museum_Copenhagen_Denmark" target="_blank">Thorvaldsen Museum-Copenhagen, Denmark</a>,” Official Local Tourism Attractions on Waymarking.com, accessed 13 April 2021; <span class="CharOverride-1"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bertel-Thorvaldsen" target="_blank">Encyclopedia Britannica Online</a></span>, s.v. “Bertel Thorvaldsen,” accessed 5 October 2021; Dyveke Helsted, O.

It was founded by Georg Carstensen (31 August 1812 &#8211; 4 January 1857), son of a diplomat, who was raised largely in the Middle East, although “his schooling took place in Denmark.” After extensive travel, he “returned to live permanently to Copenhagen in 1839,” where his work in publishing two periodicals taught him “how to arrange popular entertainment.” In 1841, King Christian VIII granted him “permission to establish and run” a pleasure garden that he initially called “Tivoli and Vauxhall,” after the Jardin de Tivoli in Paris (itself named after the town of Tivoli in Italy) and Vauxhall Gardens in London; by the time the gardens opened, the name had been reduced simply to “Tivoli.” Construction began in May 1843, and the gardens opened on 15 August of that year. “The season lasted until 11 October, at the end of which Tivoli had seen 174,609 guests” (“The Beginning,” and “The Founder,” <a href="http://www.tivoli.dk/en/om/historie/tivolis+grundlaegger/" target="_blank">Tivoli website</a>, accessed 3 March 2016). “Tivoli was from the very start in 1843, a great success with a variety of attractions: restaurants, concerts, flower gardens, and many amusements [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] rides. In the evening the park was illuminated and at closing hours fireworks lit up the gardens and parts of the city.” The garden had a lake, and a fountain beside which was a concert hall for theater performances and “human exhibitions” of “exotic and tropical” individuals portraying “everyday life in India” (“<a href="https://www.copenhagenet.dk/CPH-Map/CPH-Tivoli.asp" target="_blank">Tivoli–Copenhagen</a>,” Copenhagen Portal website, accessed 18 February 2021).</span></p>

It “is built of red brick, in the Gothic style, on three little islands in a small lake, which are connected by bridges. The chief wing so completely covers the island on which is is built, that it seems to rise immediately from the water, … The village of Hilleröd surrounds the castle lake on three sides, and on the fourth it is bounded by pleasant walks and gardens laid out on the sloping banks of the lake.” The Royal Castle contains an extensive collection of portraits that were described in 1849 as being “interesting in an historical point of view, and not as works of art.” “The gardens … are laid out in the French style.” The description in Murray’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Handbook for Northern Europe</span> stresses the “lovely walks around Frederiksborg, whence the castle is seen to great advantage,” and the beauty of the Royal Forest (Murray’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Handbook for Northern Europe</span>, vol. 1, pp. 86, 87).</span></p>

Munier, hatter, all from France; Mr. G. Schirning, Danish government officer, Mrs. F. Wallich, lady, D.F. Oster, government officer, and Lieutenant E. Lauritzen, all of Copenhagen; Franz Potemsky, servant, and Hein Nebendahl, traveler, both of Russia; and Hindus Kissan Das Bairage, traveler, from Bengal (Lists of Immigrants July 1848, HO 3/48, PRO). Apparently, Americans were not considered aliens by British immigration. As the Countess de Berg was the only foreign countess on board, it is probably she and Miss Zuerer that Anna Whistler intended when she spoke of the “Italian Countess and her companion.” Either Mr. Schanlan or S. Munier was the Frenchman who was “very amusing” to James and Willie. Madame Françoise Dume (or Dumée), the Ingersoll family cook, is the French cook referred to (AVPRI: Fond MID, Kants. [Fond Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chancery], 1848, op. 469, d. 60/Etats Unis, Ralph I. Ingersoll to Nesselrode St. P., 18/30 June 1848, fol. 11). For further information about her, see BUHG: Colin Ingersoll Journal, pt. 1, fol. 60. “Hein Nebendahl” is most likely Johann Heinrich Nebendahl, a merchant of the Second Guild, residing in St. Petersburg (Amburger Datenbank, ID 74471). Hindus Kissan Das Bairage was the “Hindoo whose portrait Jemie is wishing to take.” The Hindus would, of course, be of interest to Whistler specialists because of the possibility that James drew his portrait and gave it to him, but attempts to further identify him have not been successful. No consulted native speaker of German could propose a meaning for “Das Bairage.”</span></p>

In any case, both he and the doctor, a “proud citizen of Copenhagen,” disembarked there. On her way back to Russia in September 1848, when she once again visited Copenhagen, Anna Whistler wrote James that she had not seen either Mr. Sharon or the doctor, which seems to indicate that both lived there (Anna Whistler, aboard the S.S. “City of Aberdeen,” to James, 22 September 1848, GUL: Whistler Collection, W360). It has not been possible to identify Mr. Sharon. The city residents’ book of St. Petersburg for the letter “Sh,” which lists property owners, gives the name of a foreign merchant, Nikolai Petrov Sharon. It also gives the names of the heirs of a deceased councilor and nobleman in the Polish service, Nikolai, and his deceased wife, Iustina Sharon. However, as Mr. Sharon’s first name is not given in Anna Whistler’s diary, it is impossible to know whether she met the foreign merchant, one of the sons or grandsons who were the heirs of Nicholas and Iustina Sharon, or someone else named Sharon (TsGIA SPb: Fond 781, op. 4, d. 82. Alfavit gorodskoi obyvatel’skoi knigi 1820g. “Sh” [Alphabetical listing of city residents’ book for 1820, “Sh”], fols. 10r, 36v). The volume goes beyond 1820.

He worked on this project almost until his death. He began in 1821 with sketch models of Christ, Peter, and Paul. In a few years, he had plaster models of all the figures, including the Baptismal Angel. In subsequent years, he transferred the statues for the interior of the church into marble and the pediment figures into terra cotta. By the mid-1830s, all the marble statues except for the apostles Thaddeus and Andrew were completed. In 1841, he made new sketch models of these two apostles, which were not, however, completed in marble until after his death (Dyveke Helsted, Eva Hanschen, and Bjarne Jørnaes, <span class="CharOverride-1">Thorvaldsen</span>, trans.

The print of the nails and the wound in his side are there, but are shown with extreme restraint as recognition symbols.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text6">There are many legends about the special expression and the position of the arms on this statue; some have spoken about a divine intervention in the creation, others, on the contrary, of the arms of the clay model sinking overnight. It is easy to forget – in such oversimplified theories – the very real battle that Thorvaldsen had with the proportions of this giant figure in relation both to its final site and to its function. That Thorvaldsen had in fact owned a painting which probably served as model for the figure of Christ (Peter Cornelius: the Five Wise and the Five Foolish Virgins, 1816, now in the Düsseldorf Museum of Art) does not change the fact that the figure is a sculptural success.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text6">It has been pointed out that the strongly compelling effect of the statue is due to the contrasting signals coming from the stylized reserve of the face on the one hand and the bodily warmth of the arms on the other; the welcoming gesture of the arms on the one hand and – on the other – the fact that the figure, resting on the back foot, gives the impression that it is withdrawing” (Helsted, Hanschen, and Jørnaes, p.&#160;89). </p>

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">In a widely sweeping curve of a beautiful bay, there is a kind of chasm, or opening in one of the lofty cliffs which bound it. This produces a very romantic and striking effect. The steep descending sides of this opening in the cliff are covered with trees, bushes, wild flowers, fern, wormwood, and many other herbs, here and there contrasted with bold masses of rock or brown earth. </p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation2">In the higher part of one of these declivities, two or three picturesque cottages are fixed, and seem half suspended in the air. </p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation2">From the upper extremity of this great fissure, or opening in the cliff, a small stream of water enters by a cascade, and flows through the bottom, winding in a varied course of about a quarter of a mile in length; and then runs into the sea, across a smooth expanse of firm hard sand, at the lower extremity of the chasm. At this point, the sides of the woody banks are very lofty, and, to a spectator from the bottom, exhibit a mixture of the grand and beautiful not often exceeded. … </p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation2">I walked up by a steep pathway, that winded through the trees and shrubs on the side of one of the precipices. At every step, the extent of prospect enlarged, and acquired a new and varying character by being seen through the trees on each side. Climbing up a kind of rude, inartificial set of stone stairs in the bank, I passed by the singularly-situated cottages which I had viewed from beneath, … [and] arrived at the top of the precipice. … From this point the abyss, occasioned by the great fissure in the cliff, appeared grand and interesting. Trees hung over it on each side, projecting not only their branches, but many of their roots in wild and fantastic forms.

			<p class="Endnote-text-after-quote2">Barber, in his<span class="CharOverride-1"> Picturesque Guide</span>, refers to Richmond’s text:</p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">The stream which finds its way to the sea through the chasm it has so greatly assisted in producing, rises in the down beyond Shanklin, and, as it approaches the village, may be tracked as it flows by the fine forest trees that line its banks. Its course, just before it reaches the head of the chine, is along a bed of stones, placed to prevent the further wear of the sand-rock, and thence over a broad flat stone, supported as a projecting ledge to increase the effect of the fall, the natural descent of which is about thirty feet. The half-way view from which the cascade is seen on the one hand, and, behind, and around, nothing but the precipitous winding sides of the abyss is picturesque beyond description, especially if the sun aids the effect by throwing into alternate light and shade the projections and recesses on one side, while the other wholely sleeps in comparative gloom. Another striking effect, as noticed by Mr. Richmond, is that produced by the mouth of the chasm, when the spectator stands facing it on the shore. Here the cliffs are about 280 feet high, and the width of the opening at top is at least 300 feet. The desolate and barren aspect of the rocks on the left offers a fine contrast to that of their opposite neighbours, whose steeps are clothed with wood, and broken by cottages and gardens, the latter well stocked with vegetables and fruit trees … At the foot of the cliff is the habitation of a fisherman, to whom visitors are indebted for the path cut along the arid rock to the summit of the chine, and who expects a small gratuity from those who ascend the chasm by means of the accommodation he has provided.

			<p class="Endnote-text6">Seeing the luxuriant soil on the Isle of Wight, where so much more could be grown, thus making their food less expensive, Anna Whistler was reminded of Oberlin’s success with barren fields. He organized an agricultural club, “introduced new vegetables and gave instruction as to their cultivation.” He “investigated … the nature of the [local] soil and learned what it was adapted to produce.” He replaced an unproductive kind of potato with one from France, which produced a successful crop. He brought “much waste land … into use” by teaching his parishioners about fertilizers and irrigation and introduced “better and more modern” agricultural implements. The agricultural club was followed by a horticultural society and nurseries. “Trees more appropriate for the climate” were introduced. He applied the principles he taught to two barren fields owned by the parsonage and created “a fruitful orchard in a few years,” winning over skeptics who had been unwilling to accept his mixing piety with practical and utilitarian proposals for an improved life. Anna Whistler would have appreciated that religious motives not only underlay all he planned and taught, but that this foundation was visibly evident (Augustus F. Beard, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Story of John Frederic Oberlin</span> [Boston, New York, and Chicago: Pilgrim Press, 1909], pp. 98, 99 100, 101, 102, 103).

The son of a Congregational minister, Smith “originally intended to be a printer and bookbinder.” On deciding to be a Congregational minister, he entered Highbury College. “He displayed, at an early period of his ministerial career, the qualities which characterized him through the remainder of his life – viz., great courage, faith and determination.” “His career was unique, useful, and self-sacrificing.” While living in Brading, Isle of Wight, wating for “an invitation to a vacant pulpit,” he worked to promote “the religious interests of the inhabitants.” This led to an invitation by the local Congregationalists “to become their minister.” Despite the fact that “the chapel was wretchedly situated” and the income small, he accepted. In time, he was instrumental in raising funds to have a schoolhouse with a playground built for “the children of Dissenters” (who had “no day school”) as well as a house for the schoolmaster, “a new chapel [and] a minister’s house.” He also succeeded in establishing a “Dissenters’ burial ground.” Anna Whistler met him and his wife and young family of two children after these endeavors had been accomplished, for she was charmed by the “new gothic chapel” with the Smiths’ attractive apartment in the basement and the beautiful garden, which was actually a burial ground. Reverend Smith next went to Halesworth in Suffolk. Here there was not “scope enough for his special powers,” so he went to Surbiton, near Kingston-on-Thames, and essentially proceeded as he had at Brading. First he opened “a room in his house,” leading to the eventual building of a chapel. He “resigned his charge in 1861, and became minister of Hope Chapel, Hanley.” “[A]n amateur artist and art critic … he [also] used art as a means of preaching.” At Hope Chapel, he was “especially successful among the working classes, who came in large numbers to hear his Sunday afternoon lectures, and to see the large pictures illustrating the parables, which he painted week by week for their benefit.” In 1865, he quit Hanley and went to Gospel Oak Fields, near Hampstead Heath, where once again he undertook to form a congregation, resulting in the building of the Gospel Oak Congregational Chapel in that same year.

He had a dread of mere religious conventionalities and mechanical contrivances to secure religious ends, and insisted on the necessity for living by principle, and not by expediency.” Anna Whistler appreciated these qualities in the still-young Reverend Smith, noting in her diary his zeal and eloquence and his “deeply impressive and interesting manner” in addressing children, all of which led her to pay him one of her highest compliments: that “the name of dissenter is merged in that of christian,” in meeting “with such an one as” he (Censuses for 1851, 1861, 1871, and 1881; <span class="CharOverride-1">The Nonconformist and Independent</span> 256, no. 5, new series, November 20, 1884; <span class="CharOverride-1">The Congregational Yearbook, 1885, pp. </span>227–229; Register of Baptisms, Lock`s Fields Independent Chapel, York Street, Walworth, Surrey, RG 4/4202, NAUK; <span class="CharOverride-1">National Probate Calendar </span>(UK), 1884; <span class="CharOverride-1">The Hampstead and Highgate Express</span>, November 15, 1884, p.&#160;30, and November 22, 1884).</p>

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">The town of Cheltenham is situated in the beautiful vale of Gloucester, between the left bank of the Severn and the lovely Cotswold range, which indeed forms the splendid back ground to that portion of the vale in which Cheltenham is seated – a bold projecting escarpment of the range, called Leckhampton Hill, forms a prominent feature in the landscape surrounding the Town, and from whose summit may be enjoyed a most beautiful and expansive view of the vale of Gloucester, the Malvern Hills, and the distant Welch Mountains.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation2">Since the discovery of the Mineral Springs in 1716, Cheltenham has been gradually rising into importance; the visit of His Majesty, King George the Third, with the Royal Family, in 1788, gave it great celebrity, and from a mere village it has become one of the most extensive, and certainly the most elegant town in the Kingdom.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation2">Although Cheltenham (as a Manor) dates its existence to the times previous to the compilation of “Doomsday Book,” by William the Norman, yet it now possesses no remains that would identify it with so early a period of its history; … The Parish Church is the only building of importance forming the exception to this statement, and the date of its erection may be fixed in all probability at about the 11th century. (George Rowe, <span class="CharOverride-1">Rowe’s Illustrated Cheltenham Guide </span>[Gloucester, UK: printed by the author, c. 1845], pp. iii–iv)</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text-after-quote2">The principal spas described by Rowe are the Montpellier (pp. 27–29), Royal Old Wells (pp. 35–37), and Pittville (pp. 56–59).</p>
