			<p class="Body-Text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My arrival in this beautiful city was under such trying circumstances that I could not record the meeting with my dear husband when it took place as I should have done for my twin-Sisters<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> gratification. It is exactly two months to a day since then, &amp; my mind has been so absorbed by anxiety while watching over my darling Jemmie &amp; Willie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> whose health has alternately suffered from the effects of this climate &amp; I have myself been often ill, &amp; too much depressed to write when I had leisure, but I am spurred on to make the exertion to begin a journal now, on reflecting that however trifling the events of my home, they may be interesting to review in after years, at all events to my little boys, the training of whom is my sweetest employment. This evening I am alone, their Sister at an opposite neighbours<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> &amp; their father<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> gone to sit with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Fair……<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> who is very sick. My James &amp; Willie tho only 9 and 7 years old will never forget our voyage across the Atlantic last August, for the twelve days spent on board the Acadia<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> from Boston was a term of novelties &amp; delights for them, they were such brave sailors that not even the shock we all felt (when the night after we left Halifax we run down a Barque) terrified them &amp; when they made the acquaintance of the crew of that vessel which our Capt had taken on board just in time to save these 14 poor fellows from sinking in their own<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> — they were so eager to relate to me all the particulars of the adventures that I doubt not they felt like heroes themselves. Fondly does their poor mother now recal all those days! — when surrounded by her diminished family circle, &amp; while thankful for present comforts — misses sadly her dear George<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> who has returned to our native land — &amp; weeps over her loss of little Charlie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> tho she knows he is a bright angel in heaven &amp; she would not wish him again in this world of sin &amp; trial — yet the sad void made by the death of this darling can never be filled to his fond mother, his 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span> anniversary was passed on board the Acadia the 27<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of last August. “Charlie is two years old” he was so pleased to repeat to all who asked how old he was — he spoke so distinctly &amp; had so many original ideas, that but for his fragile form &amp; delicacy of skin so very infantine — he would have been thought older, he used to enjoy playing on deck as much as his two seniors Jemmie &amp; Willie, for his own kind nurse Mary<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> watched him &amp; he was always happy if she were only by his side. I musn’t linger, but tell of our arrival in Liverpool at 6 oclock on the morning of the 29<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of August 1843.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> &amp; of the kind welcome we found at dear M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Sandlands<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> to whose house we immediately went. she has since recalled (in a sympathising letter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> to me) my Charlies remark as he watched her knitting “I remember Grandmother” he said in his gentle fond tones! Oh we shall never forget <span class="CharOverride-1">him</span>! It would be quite impossible to describe the meeting with my Sisters,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> especially the arrival of myself &amp; children at Preston, my Sister Eliza’s face spoke volumes &amp; she said there had not been such perfect satisfaction as hers, since Josephs welcoming his father &amp; family in Egypt!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> How much the weather combined to add to my enjoyment on revisiting England &amp; meeting so many old friends after an absence of 14 years! I admired the perfect verdure of the green fields hills &amp; valleys (even as much as I had Niagaras green wave when I gazed on it last June)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> bright sunshine attended us every day, &amp; my soul was filled with wonder &amp; with adoration that God should thus distinguish us with such unclouded happiness. James &amp; Willie played in their good Uncle Winstanleys<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> garden, or went with the little sons of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Chapman<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> to ride on their donkey. My precious darling Charlie had his morning or afternoon strolls with his nurse Mary. his sweet voice was the first sound that attracted me at the hour of day. he would come in by himself to say good morning to his dear mother &amp; stand by my window peeping out thro the blind to discover what was passing in Fishergate S<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʈ</span>.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> &amp; when I was dressed I carried him in my arms to the drawing room where he would point his tiny finger to a beautiful painting over the mantle piece (of Miss Maudes)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> &amp; say “Mama theres Raphael”.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> Sometime he would stand at the head of the stairs where the full length portrait of <span class="CharOverride-1">Mary Maclean</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> hung in a vestibule &amp; pointing to it say “theres the “Scotch beauty” it looks like Cozey Mary. Cozey Julie!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> The first drive we had, my dear Sister would take <span class="CharOverride-1">all</span> the children, our friends M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Sandland &amp; her Eliza<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> being on a visit to her, were with us, so that the carriage was full &amp; Charlies nurse was left at home, even tho seated on his mothers lap, his affection for Mary induced the little darling to miss <span class="CharOverride-1">her</span> &amp; before our afternoons drive was over to say “I wonder what Mary is doing! “Charlie must go home to Mary”! Oh how much intelligence this <span class="CharOverride-1">baby</span> discovered! &amp; he was so gentle so full of love I ought to have been warned that he was ripening for the skies — but he seemed to be improving in health &amp; I flattered myself as his difficulties in teething were over he would become stout &amp; Oh how often I fancied the delight his father would take in “Kirkies<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> own Charlie” as that little sainted brother used to call the baby — Charlie was no longer a baby, he did not fancy toys, but delighted in flowers, &amp; his <span class="CharOverride-1">hymn book — </span>as he called the nursery rhymes — was in his hand always, for he even took it to bed with him, Even ere we had left Stonington he had distinguished the Lords day &amp; used to say “not to pay drum on Sunday” &amp; he never omitted repeating the Lords prayer after Mary any night or morning, he discovered a remarkable fondness for music “Sissee pay for Charlie” then would lead Debo to the piano &amp; ask for “Lucy Long”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> Sometimes if he heard her hum a familiar air he would call it by name &amp; add “come Sissee play that for Charlie” Friends flocked daily to my Sisters hospitable mansion to see us, for our visit was to be too brief to admit of our making many excursions — my boys used to ask their Aunts “who were to dine <span class="CharOverride-1">that</span> day, or who coming to stay longer to see Mother!” but one morning we rose early enough to ride twelve miles to breakfast at Ribchester.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> dear Jane Simpson<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> was with us. Aunt Eliza. Aunt Alicia &amp; the three little boys. Never, never can I forget that happy morning! I loved the dear family at the parsonage<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> &amp; felt it a privilige to take <span class="CharOverride-1">my children</span> to visit them. How beautiful the valley of the Ribble looked as we gazed at it from the top of the rising ground just as we approached Ribchester!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> How gratifying our welcome from the excellent M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hazlewood,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> his dear wife<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> &amp; children!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hazlewood wept as she embraced me for at that moment her grief for the loss of her Elizabeth revived, that sweet girl had been my pet when I was last in England, but when she attained her 17<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>year God called her to her heavenly inheritance, she died last July,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> &amp; had given so many evidences of her love for her Saviour that we ought to rejoice that she was released from sufferings here &amp; so soon gathered to His fold, her mother only whispered me “I wish I could have shewn her to you!” After breakfast I went up stairs to put my darling Charlie to sleep, &amp; while afterwards I walked with my friend &amp; listened to all the interesting particulars of her Elizabeths life &amp; death, he was being refreshed by a mornings nap. I felt while talking with M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> H how “good to be here! my affections became elevated as her devotion glowed in her words “Is it not comforting to reflect on the love of our Heavenly Father? Is it not delightful to think that He gives his Angels charge of us &amp; tho they are invisible to us we are continually surrounded by them” She spoke of the Coming of Christ of his 2<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span> Advent<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span> as an event full of blessedness. Oh I felt if we all could make our intercourse with friends thus profitable, if every visiter was so fed with heavenly food! the hours flew as we walked &amp; opened our hearts to each other, but we went into the old church with its fine old carved pulpit &amp; richly colored glass windows,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span> so different to any my boys had seen we could hardly get them out but, Catherine H loom was even more interesting &amp; novel to James who wove very readily. this sweet young girl only 12 years of age, weaves as a pastime that she may clothe the poor, she reminded me of her Sister Elizabeth, &amp; may she become indeed like her. Every day of the fortnight spent under my dear brother Winstanleys roof was so precious, each is recorded on my memory, but I cannot write of each, his good Sister M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ainslie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> died the last Sunday we were in Preston, she was a true christian, her “good works do follow her”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> but her hopes in her Saviour alone made her so happy in her death, she had never murmured at her sufferings during two years, (from cancer), but was thro her illness, as she had been thro life, an example to us all. her funeral was to take place the very day we took the Cars for London. The kind Ormerods<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> who had been so untiring in their proofs of regard for us spent the day but one at my brothers half promising to come again to say good bye thus to avoid the pain of it in reality. My dear Sister Alicia had made up her mind to accompany us to London, at prayers that morning of the 14<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>of Sept my sister Elizas voice faltered &amp; my tears fell silently. My brother Winny<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> had found an excuse for taking the early train for Liverpool, to avoid seeing us go from his house. My heart was full of sorrow &amp; I followed him with my darling Charlie who ran after “Unc Winstanley for one more embrace. I think now I can see his little form tottering on the gravel walk, in his eagerness to reach that kind uncle — whom he was to be no longer with in this world! The only showery day we had in England was during our journey to London, which rendered it pleasanter. When we stopped our old friend M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Stevenson<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-041">41</a></span></span> was at the depot waiting to welcome me with a letter from my beloved Whistler. We found our lodging commodious &amp; retired at Kents in Norfolk S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Strand —<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-042">42</a></span></span> And I experienced more than ever the disinterested affection of my Sister Alicia, she took James &amp; Willie to be her bed fellows &amp; was unbounded in her indulgence to the little trio during that pleasant week. To M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ralston<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-043">43</a></span></span> I am under great obligations for advising &amp; aiding us in our arrangements for proceeding to my husband — And the attentions we received from D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Bootts<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-044-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-044">44</a></span></span> family were as unexpected as gratifying, the dear old lady his mother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-045-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-045">45</a></span></span> was many times at our lodgings offering to take us to the Parks<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-046-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-046">46</a></span></span> &amp;c. One afternoon my sister &amp; self availed ourselves of her carriage &amp; took the boys to the Zoological Gardens,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-047-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-047">47</a></span></span> how delighted little Charlie was in Aunt Alicias arms, or running sometimes himself along the walks, he made many smile when he clapped his hands with delight at the Giraffes &amp; called them pretty Peacocks. We spent another afternoon at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Stevensons, all of us staid to tea even our little one for his nurse also could find a welcome there, I observed with pain the weight of a dozen years of sorrow upon dear M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʀ</span> Stevenson,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-048-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-048">48</a></span></span> her Eliza<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-049-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-049">49</a></span></span> is now what she was beautiful &amp; attractive Debo &amp; she soon became fond of each other, Bell<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-050-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-050">50</a></span></span> the family nurse could scarcely look at any of the group for little Charlies fondness for his Mary carried her back to auld lang syne when she had been as blessed by the little Stevensons endearments, but even Frankey<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-051-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-051">51</a></span></span> the youngest had grown to be so great a lad he has a situation from home so that only Miss Eliza remains. We were glad again to find the Poizats<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-052-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-052">52</a></span></span> in London, they had been such acquisitions to us on board the Acadia, when they called upon us little Charlie recognized them immediately &amp; went up to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Poizat holding out his hand for him to put Cologne water upon it. At last we were obliged to bid adieu to dear Aunt Alicia &amp; take the Steamer for Hamburg.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-053">53</a></span></span> she sat up all that night &amp; I most of it talking with that kind Sister. The children were aroused before dawn, my darling baby seemed at once to understand he was going to “father” for he was not the least peevish at being disturbed, tho Mary could not persuade him there was no time to say Charlies prayers - she found it was best to gratify him &amp; let him kneel as usual &amp; repeat the Lords prayer - As the boatmen rowed us down the Thames by lamplight &amp; starlight how charmed this bright little creature was! And when we descended the ladies cabin on board the John Bull from the Wherry<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-054">54</a></span></span> he continued to tell us that “Charlie was wide awake” which I feared might disturb any passengers who might wish to sleep, but one of the ladies said the next day, how amused she was to hear such a baby talk. My darling continued well during the trip to Hamburg &amp; the few hours we spent at the Hotel<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-055-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-055">55</a></span></span> in that city he was no trouble, but always a source of joy — George obtained two carriages for us as we were to travel all night, most comfortable they were — Never in my life have I enjoyed a ride as much as ours that night, I felt too happy to wish to close my eyes, my children all around me, all in health, &amp; going to their father. Oh I often pondered on the mercies I felt I so little deserved &amp; wondered from what quarter the black cloud would arise when the change should come — The road was fine, the stars shone so brightly I could see many interesting pictures of Denmark.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-056-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-056">56</a></span></span> We stopped very frequently under large sheds to bait the horses<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-057-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-057">57</a></span></span> &amp; many toll bars too there were. Willies nights rest was unbroken but James &amp; little Charlie were as bright as the stars, &amp; had so much to point out to Mother! George got out at one of the little Inns &amp; procured us coffee &amp; cakes at midnight, the best I almost ever tasted — The Entrance to Lubec<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-058-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-058">58</a></span></span> is very pretty, it was early dawn when our carriages stopped out side the gates of the town till our passports were inspected when we were allowed to pass thro without much detention. At the hotel in Lubec we made our toilette &amp; breakfasted, my darling ate his bread &amp; milk with relish &amp; took a refreshing nap until we were summoned at Noon to take the stage for Travemunde. As we rode I watched all my family group, he the picture of health sleeping in the arms of his sleeping nurse. Our dear George was to bid us adieu at the Steamer Alexandra.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-059-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-059">59</a></span></span> We were threatened at first with opposition to my taking my boys into the Ladies Cabin &amp; a State room appropriated to us in the forward Cabin, but it seemed too solitary for us, &amp; especially as I had a dread of meeting a storm on the Baltic<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-060-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-060">60</a></span></span> this being the 22<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span> of Sept. Ah how well it proved that we were not separated from the other lady passengers — whose sympathy &amp; kindness I can never forget. At last the trial came of parting from our dear George. Willie was almost heartbroken &amp; for two hours was inconsolable. When little Charlie observed my grief he said “Mary! brother George gone! Mama cry! poor brother George, Charlie wants him back again” We exerted ourselves for each others sake &amp; Debo &amp; I took James &amp; Willie to dinner table – when I returned from the saloon having left my baby apparently well I consented to walk the deck with Debo for an hour to cheer her knowing how much she needed it on losing sight of George who had been of such comfort to us on our former voyages. When I went back to the Ladies Cabin I observed with astonishment Charlies quietness. Mary then told me he had refused to eat &amp; seemed sea sick, but we both hoped it would soon pass &amp; relieve him. I took him to my own bosom for whenever he felt ill Charlie was most comfortable in his mothers arms, that night he never left them except to try change of position in the berth in hopes he might sleep, but no he did not close his eyes, I administered powders once or twice put up for him by his good Uncle Palmer<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-061-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-061">61</a></span></span> &amp; which in all other attacks had benefitted this precious child, I must not omit in the evening when Mary would have lain her darling in the berth to pat him to sleep he tried to kneel down first to say “Charlies prayers”supporting himself by holding to the sides of it, “Charlie is too sick to kneel down, say them in bed” which he did clasping his little hands together as he was wont &amp; repeating every word, it was the last time in his little life here below! tho he expressed the same wish again the next night. The next morning was Sunday 23<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƨ</span><span class="CharOverride-9">,</span> the symptoms of illness had increased, the little patient never murmured, but could retain no medicine, the last dose I administered he said gently “Most done, no more medi Mama for Charlie <span class="CharOverride-1">if you please</span>” Debo was much concerned for her little favorite brother &amp; longed for a physician, I knew that God alone could bless the means &amp; I felt comfort in believing in His presence Once sweet Charlie turned &amp; said “Sissee” as tho he would like to prove he loved her but he went not from his mother even to Mary, till she had gone to her berth on Sunday night, when I put him in her arms in hopes her warmth would impart some to him, his extremities had become so clammy! I walked the cabin with him after all had retired for the nausea distressed him, at last laid down wrapping myself around him to try to warm him, he put his cold little hands in my bosom saying “Charlies <span class="CharOverride-1">own</span>, mama” but neither he or I closed our eyes from the moment we first embarked, as my baby neither fretted or moaned I was only aware of his increased sufferings by his struggles &amp; starting out of the berth with him flew into the deserted cabin, my sobs aroused Debo from her berth &amp; her cries of distress brought out all the ladies, the steward too ran in &amp; as the kindest act he supposed was to conceal the agonies of death from a mothers eyes he hastily put out the light, but soon restored the lamp upon my pleading for it. A warm bath too he had ready in a few moments &amp; I put my darling in it supposing he was threatened with a fit, as one of the ladies hinted it might be from his teeth. I cut his gums myself for none other was there to do it &amp; God gave me strength in that hour or surely nature could not have supported it. Never shall I forget the look of fond recognition from my dying babys eyes &amp; as<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-062-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-062">62</a></span></span> held him in my arms in the warm bath which evidently relieved him. I wrapped his little body in a blanket which the compassionate Stewardess tho she could not speak a word of English handed me, &amp; sat down gazing on the angelic expression of my Charlie for now I realized that his mild eyes could not long be turned to his poor mother, mine were rivetted till his were glazed by death. I pressed my lips in agony to his fair beautiful brow, then gave up that precious body to stranger hands as they besought me &amp; went to my state room to break the sad tidings to poor Mary whom no one had awakened, Oh how my heart bled as she uttered the grief my lips refused! And deploring her desolation I comforted her if I might with assurances of my love for her for Charlies sake who had loved her so much &amp; for whose sake she had come so far from her own dearest ties.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-063-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-063">63</a></span></span> May she meet him to be separated no more! And may the lessons taught us by this “little one” shine still on our path, tho dead he yet speaketh, little Charlie could not be persuaded to go to his bed or to rise from it without kneeling down to pray to God in the words which Jesus himself taught us to use, little Charlie distinguished Sunday &amp; may his brothers remember the lesson I tried to draw from the sad event when I told them of their loss the next morning, that God had called this second little brother to a better world on the sabbath day to impress their minds solemnly on its return every week to keep it holy. Kirkie had left them for heaven on a beautiful Sabbath morning only a year ago last July, his hands clasped in prayer &amp; his bright eyes raised in extacy as tho he saw what we could not - angelic messengers! his last words were “Mother I want to go to heaven” &amp; now “Kirkies own Charlie” as he used to call the baby whom he loved so peculiarly! had joined him on the hallowed evening of the sabbath, how blissful the meeting of these two pure spirits! Jesus has assured us “of such is the kingdom of heaven”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-064-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-064">64</a></span></span> little Charlie lost his Kirkie when he was not quite a year old, so he could not remember his beautiful brother of four years old, but his fondness for his miniature<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-065-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-065">65</a></span></span> was very remarkable &amp; under any circumstances it was preferred by him to any thing that could be offered, he would kiss it many times, call the picture “Charlies own Kirkies” &amp; hug it to his breast. And now they are <span class="CharOverride-1">forever</span> together! happy beyond our conception. Oh may we so live that they may welcome us to where all tears shall be wiped from our eyes! I will not wring my heart by recording the sad task which I aided Mary to perform, but it was a privilige for me to hold him the next morning in my arms while she fondly arranged his beautiful ringlets in the vain hope that his father might look upon him even tho he could not speak to tell how much Charlie had loved him. his precious corpse occupied that lovely forward cabin which it had been proposed our family should have for the voyage, &amp; poor Mary &amp; I used to visit it every day, indeed she could not go to her berth at night till she saw her beloved charged<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-066-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-066">66</a></span></span> &amp; thus assured herself nothing could harm the body she still loved. The fourth morning after my babys death we were at Cronstadt<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-067-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-067">67</a></span></span> &amp; then I heard it was prohibited taking any corpse to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg &amp; I must submit to leaving this that seemed indeed a part of myself at Cronstadt but it would be placed in the sanctuary - in the English church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-068-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-068">68</a></span></span> - I was wound up to endure all that combined to deepen my distress without uttering complaint. knowing that our Heavenly Father ordered all this chastening for my good. Ah how clouded was my joy at the approaching meeting with my dear husband! My boys were continually exclaiming at the brilliant objects which presented, as we sailed up the Neva, each clinging to their new acquaintance the young count Strauganauf<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-069-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-069">69</a></span></span> who was so indulgent as to answer all their questions about the gilded spires, domes, &amp;c. At last when our Steamer stopped at the English quay, I having once more to encounter the officers of the customs went into the Cabin to shew our passport, on returning to the deck I heard Whistlers voice calling Jemmie for most tantalizing case! he was not permitted to go on board to meet &amp; welcome us - but at length after another officer had stopped me about our passport, we stepped ashore &amp; my dear husbands happiness was complete, none but God knows the weight of sorrow at my heart to think I must so soon embitter his joy. I dreaded his turning round to look after the children as he did often, at last he seemed to wonder what our nurse had done with him he looked in vain for, but as he would begin with “where is the little one, I abruptly stopped by begging him not to ask me any questions till he could do so at home, he must have seen agony depicted on my countenance &amp; he has since told me his heart sunk as [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] the dreadful thought that our baby had by some fearful accident found a watery grave, I will not linger at the Custom house<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-070-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-070">70</a></span></span> for it was truly harrassing to stop there while our trunks were rudely overhauled,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-071-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-071">71</a></span></span> however we were more civilly treated than at first promised &amp; soon after Whistlers friend M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-072-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-072">72</a></span></span> came there &amp; was introduced to Debo &amp; I, he very kindly offered to stay with Mary thro the rest of the examination, then Whistler gladly drove us home our S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> — the Galernia — being the very next back of the English quay. I felt much overcome, yet Oh so grateful as I viewed our comfortable home.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-073-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-073">73</a></span></span> A fine ship offering to sail for Boston<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-074-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-074">74</a></span></span> our kind friend Major Bouttatz<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-075-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-075">75</a></span></span> went the very next day to Cronstadt, had the precious body put in a leaden coffin &amp; sent back to its native land, which was a cause of thankfulness to Whistler &amp; myself that it might be placed in the same grave with our Kirkie, in the same enclosure with our sainted boys Joe &amp; Henry.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-076-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-076">76</a></span></span> This climate was detrimental to my recovery for some weeks &amp; my dear James &amp; Willie were ill by turns from the effect of the Neva water, so that my cares did not cease, but I had such a desire to aid &amp; comfort my dear husband who had I knew anticipated such, after his years exile from us. I tried to appear cheerful, I encountered fewer difficulties in housekeeping than I had expected too in the great Russian capital, found every convenience in our kitchens, pantries &amp;c, the servants<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-077-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-077">77</a></span></span> speak some English, &amp; Mary such a comfort to me! The weather was thro Oct very delightful, occasionally the Neva rose &amp; the guns were fired to warn the inhabitants on the islands to be on their guard against an inundation! but we were not alarmed tho one day the water run thro our S<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʊ</span> from the river. We are blessed in excellent neighbours M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W<span class="CharOverride-9">m</span> Ropes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-078-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-078">78</a></span></span> from Boston (who has the only American mercantile establishment here) he even insisted upon having our dinners cooked for us the first few days, &amp; in every particular has evinced interest in his Yankee acquaintances. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> R a nice young English lady with two nice little girls,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-079-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-079">79</a></span></span> she proves a superior musician, &amp; many times herself &amp; our Debo practised duetts, alternately at either home, until on the 18<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>of this month M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> R came over for us to rejoice with him in the birth of a third little daughter!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-080-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-080">80</a></span></span> Winter kept off till about that time, the river closed suddenly &amp; we have had snow almost every day. I have felt no wish to go out, but had to make the effort occasionally to return calls with Debo. Our fellow passengers M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Nichol Baird<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-081-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-081">81</a></span></span> &amp; her sister Miss Kremmer<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-082-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-082">82</a></span></span> were among the first who left cards for us, they are exceedingly intellectual and agreeable, &amp; as I associate with them all their sympathy &amp; kind attentions in my affliction I always am glad to see them. they are Germans but speak English perfectly, the Bairds are a rich English family<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-083-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-083">83</a></span></span> here — One of the first ladies who came to see me was M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Hirst,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-084-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-084">84</a></span></span> as her sister to whom I had brought a letter from Preston<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-085-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-085">85</a></span></span> was too great an invalid, I was also much inclined to make a friend of this English lady but my Willies illness made me unwilling to go out &amp; after his recovery my own health was so feeble I have not yet returned that pleasant call. One day it is true Debo &amp; I were just ready to step into a carriage to ride to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hirsts when strange to tell our lad Alexander<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-086-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-086">86</a></span></span> who had never refused before to do any thing we required — refused to act footman, the carriage was dismissed &amp; alas poor Alex in 1/2 an hour after, to the grief of Jemmie who was teaching him English — &amp; to my vexation too, for now I had all the annoyance of teaching Maurice<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-087-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-087">87</a></span></span> the duties of butler &amp;c. About that very time too we had a new Dwanick<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-088-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-088">88</a></span></span> so that poor Mary used to be perplexed how to tell these two foreigners the work of the house. but our cook<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-089-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-089">89</a></span></span> who is uncommonly good natured &amp; speaks english left her duties whenever necessary to interpret for us. Our Crate of China, boxes of books, silver, Harp &amp;c had to be unpacked by Mary with our aid, really we were almost in despair about our new Dwanick he was so like a bear, had not long been in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P &amp; never in a decent house before, he used to smoke us out when he lit the peeches,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-090-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-090">90</a></span></span> every step he took shewed his dirty boot, &amp; Debo complained of the smell of his sheep skin, &amp; Whistler declared he would pay him his months wages &amp; send poor Fritz<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-091-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-091">91</a></span></span> off. Another immediately was recommended but within the last few days after his successor was engaged, Fredric improved so astonishingly, he was up at five! the house thoroughly warmed before we left our rooms, we began to feel very sorry to think of turning the poor fellow off especially as cook told me he had left a young wife &amp; child in the country &amp; was trying to earn a subsistence for them. At lenth the newly engaged Dwanick came, new coat passport &amp;c to enter our service, he was a nice looking fellow, but Whistlers sympathies were excited for poor Fritz, who was aghast when made to comprehend he was to be displaced, to reconcile him, my kind husband gave him his choice of 25 rubles in addition to his months wages to go - or, but he saw the tears flowing over his rough cheeks &amp; consented to keep him — now what to do with the new candidate who had left a situation &amp; bought a new coat to serve us — Whistler bought his coat &amp; gave it to Fritz as an inducement to keep himself clean, &amp; payed the other a months wages to find another place with. How glad we all felt at tea to hear this negociation was ended &amp; our poor Dwanick retained. I hope he may prove a rough diamond, for he is very industrious &amp; good natured, keeps every place under his care very nice now &amp; as he wears his new coat now &amp; has learned the way to the bath looks always tidy himself. I hear him sometimes practising english words, “good, instead of “harasho” — <span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-092-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-092">92</a></span></span> this last word reminds me that I have not yet assigned a place in my narrative to one of my earliest acquaintances in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg, a poor little mendicant who so generally expresses his satisfaction by Harasho when we give him bread or money that I could almost mistake that for his name instead of Andrea,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-093-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-093">93</a></span></span> whom our boys are so glad to see come up the back stairs &amp; find his way to the parlor where he knows he is welcome for tho not more than three years old he has been a pensioner of my dear husband some months. Whistler was first attracted to poor little — Andrea in the arms of his degraded looking mother — by his resemblance to our departed Kirkie, his sparkling black eyes &amp; remarkable forehead, — but on giving the poor woman money, she touched the pavement with her brow &amp; kissed his feet before he could stop her, afterwards when he encountered them, he made signs that she should go into the yard, &amp; it used to be a sad satisfaction to him to take the child to his own room &amp; seat it on his knee, for he had provided for its coming clean to him, so these mendicants fell to my care, the first time I went down to see the mother &amp; gave her money &amp; food she kissed my feet ere I was aware of the custom here, it is so painful to me I always now send her any trifle by Mary or my little boys, but Andrea has not a cringing nature, he always comes up to shake hands with me &amp; seems to feel at perfect liberty to play with Willie while his poor mother waits below in her sheep skin, till he takes her the 25 Kopeeks silver<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-094-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-094">94</a></span></span> which he always expects for her. he is a noble looking child &amp; Oh that a way may be opened for us to serve him more effectually than by temporary relief. he looks so like our own bright eyed Kirkie, especially in a little plaid coat Willie has outgrown, which Andrea wears. Recalling incidents for the past two months I do so very irregularly. I should earlier have mentioned having had the comfort of hearing several times from home &amp; of course I have had some enjoyment in answering these precious letters &amp; in writing to my dear sisters in England. By one mail I was delighted to receive a package of papers the Christian Witness,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-095-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-095">95</a></span></span> but the postage was so frightful about $28 on 1/2 doz papers I did not think it right to open them as coming to the Legation they could decline receiving what they had not ordered. Our Ambassador Col Todd<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-096-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-096">96</a></span></span> has been very polite to us, soon after our arrival he returned from Sweden<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-097-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-097">97</a></span></span> where he had been making an excursion of pleasure, &amp; called immediately to welcome his country women to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P. Indeed we occupy Boberinskys House,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-098-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-098">98</a></span></span> which was his quarters, &amp; here Whistler had apartments (which he now lets to M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> Maxwell being on the ground floor)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-099-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-099">99</a></span></span> until the gallant Col gave up the house,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-100-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-100">100</a></span></span> which we hire ready furnished at about $18.00 per ann<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-101-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-101">101</a></span></span> — The Col has been extremely polite in offering us the use of his carriage &amp; four greys! I had been out only two or three times except to church the first month after our arrival, but one very fine day he called &amp; offered to shew us the Winter Palace,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-102-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-102">102</a></span></span> of course Debo wished to go &amp; as Whistler had never been thro it he consented to accompany us, so I had a strong inducement to over come my disinclination to going into the gay quarter of this showy city. I was very much gratified by all shewn us.

That day of his return being 22<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>of Dec I availed myself of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes offer &amp; sallied forth in quest of Christmas gifts for my dear boys, &amp; deposited a precious lock of our darling Charlies hair at a German jewellers<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-126-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-126">126</a></span></span> to have a brooche made for his own Mary, knowing it would be more acceptable than any present I could make her. On coming out of a confectioners in the Galernia<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-127-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-127">127</a></span></span> I saw Debo in a Sled with her dear father on their way to the English Magazine,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-128-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-128">128</a></span></span> they had a plot to surprise me which I did not suspect, I wished to give my boys a merry Christmas, but only anticipated the satisfaction of gratifying them in observing this anniversary. I hoped no one would wish me a <span class="CharOverride-1">merry</span> Xmas! Debo &amp; I arranged the Russian pictures<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-129-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-129">129</a></span></span> bon bons &amp;c for her little brothers in the Chancery, which no one was to enter till after breakfast. Very early their light spirits were in full flow awakening Mary- Sister - Father- Mother! too happy to realize our diminished family circle, reaching their stocking where Santa Clause had deposited sweets, after their toilettes were completed, they did not as usual pass thro my dressing-room on their way to the parlor to study their Scripture lessons till prayers, but staid in Sisters room - very mysteriously - how full of glee they seemed during breakfast! And when at last we led them to the Chancery to discover what Santa Clause had brought them their anticipations were all realized, the games just what they liked — &amp; the little chairs just what they needed — but I really believe <span class="CharOverride-1">my surprise</span> in the form of a most beautiful rose-wood Escrotoire<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-130-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-130">130</a></span></span> (which they had been privy to — for their names were signed under their dear Sisters in the affectionate note<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-131-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-131">131</a></span></span> which she presented with it to me) was more acceptable to them than their own gifts from me. their dear father took an ivory pen handle inlaid with silver with a card of gold pens from the complete Escrotoire &amp; presented it to his grateful Annie as his own peculiar gift. I was much overcome! to think I should have been singled out as the favored one o[f] the family group! I longed to relieve my full heart by tears, for I dared not attemp[t] my thanks in words, lest I should weep as I kissed each dear one whose fore thought had made me happier than I believed it possible on this day — for busy memory mourned the absence of George, &amp; made painfully visible the many broken links in our family group. But as I earnestly desired to contribute to the happiness of these left me, I courted the influence of happy childhood &amp; smothered my sad reflections Debo took the boys over to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes to present some trifles to their nursery &amp; as she staid to play some duetts with a Miss Mengies,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-132-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-132">132</a></span></span> her father &amp; I excused her to Col Todd when he called in his Sled — with four greys postillion, veils footman &amp; all to take a Christmas drive with her, we invited him to dinner but he was engaged at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gs<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-133-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-133">133</a></span></span> where we had declined going because I would not leave my boys on Christmas day. We had four American friends<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-134-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-134">134</a></span></span> to join us in roast turkey pumpkin pies &amp;c. After the dessert while we were all still seated at table Willie &amp; James spoke some french fables very prettily which they had prepared to surprise their father with. Jemmie had not committed all the lines upon the Solar System to memory<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-135-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-135">135</a></span></span> as he had intended, but Willie gave us an english peice in so touching a manner that his father said it was very pathetic. It was written by our countryman the Rev<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hawks “Give us this day our daily bread.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-136-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-136">136</a></span></span> I had said to Debo in the morning I thought she would have her offering from across the brook — American letters! They arrived early in the evening by the Steamer which left Boston on the 1<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span> We had much to be grateful for, our dear George had written &amp; the dear girls at Stonington<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-137-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-137">137</a></span></span> also, but his was a farewell &amp; it wrung sorrow from his fathers heart, what else could sustain us under such a trial but trust in God, who over-rules all the events of our lives for good “tho clouds &amp; darkness surround His throne”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-138-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-138">138</a></span></span> mercy is His prevailing attribute. Our affectionate tender George compelled to leave his native land to embark on a whole years cruise for health, with only strangers on board the ship Lausanne<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-139-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-139">139</a></span></span> his uncle the Gen<span class="CharOverride-9">1</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-140-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-140">140</a></span></span> had written us an hour after our dear boy had left New York to say George had left in good spirits, well supplied with books — among them that best of all the word of God — I could have whispered to my husband “Oh can you not trust him to God whose presence on the great deep will comfort &amp; sustain our beloved Son” but I felt that sympathy with his sorrow then would be best received, &amp; wept silently with him, tho we talked nearly the night thro of our dear George. My solace is in prayer for this most dutiful Son &amp; I have the hope that all which now seems against him shall by Gods blessing result in, <span class="CharOverride-1">enduring</span> benefits. It comforts me now to recal all Georges amiable qualities, how devoted a Son to me he has been! <span class="CharOverride-S">to</span> <span class="CharOverride-S">me</span> especially after his dear father left Springfield — And during our voyage across the Atlantic, all this will cheer me until we meet again &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">his promise</span> too to apply himself to the study of the Scriptures &amp; to join himself to the Saviours little band of followers now, in the days of his youth. Upon my pillow I recal all our conferences on this subject &amp; trust that George never forgets his mother in his prayers. We may not hear of our dear boy in many months, but God is with him. We heard by the same Steamer that the Middlesex with our precious Charlies remains had reached Boston — And that my beloved mother was on her way to Florida<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-141-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-141">141</a></span></span> — We are indeed a scattered family, but if our interests are beyond the reach of change our hearts must ever be united. I began writing my dear neice Julia on the 26<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>her 18<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> Anniversary &amp; enjoyed writing at my own complete escrotoire. Whistler looked so gratified while he pretended to laugh at my childish fondness for my beautiful desk — I never was in possession of any thing I prized so much &amp; to use the nice pen he gave me was quite charming. As I sat alone in the parlor on Thursday night<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-142-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-142">142</a></span></span> it was a temptation to scribble, for he &amp; Debo were playing upon piano &amp; flute in the next room. At 11 oclock I put my escrotoire away in the study to preserve it from dust while the parlor should be cleaned early in the morning. And when it was not in its place the next morning I suspected no evil but rather thought my dear Whistler might have removed it to his Chancery as he had much writing to do &amp; my gold pens were so excellent. thus I lost some hours, for until he confessed himself as ignorant as the children &amp; myself of what had become of their Christmas gift to their mother, I did not commence my investigation<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-143-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-143">143</a></span></span> — the servants of course would confess no knowledge of it. Maurice the German footman appeared most guilty &amp; when Whistler on glancing his eye around the music room missed also his Flute we had much reason to suspect that this young man so professedly fond of music must be the thief — all said no common depredator from the S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> would have selected such article[s] while so many more valuable articles were in the parlors &amp; all agreed that it must have been one of our own servants. The master of the police of our quarter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-144-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-144">144</a></span></span> took the poor Dvanick &amp; Maurice to the guard house to question &amp; threaten them separately but thefts in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg are so frequent, we could not entertain many hopes of being more favoured than others, altho Whistler offered a tempting reward &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">no questions</span>.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-145-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-145">145</a></span></span> It pained me that I (who had known so many sorrows) should for several days allow this disappointment to weigh upon my spirit, it is not safe in this world to set too high a value upon any gift, we can at best only enjoy for an indefinite period all here below, but we a [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>]<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-146-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-146">146</a></span></span> only as “children of a larger growth &amp; are fond of earthly toys”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-147-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-147">147</a></span></span> the flute was dear to us from many tender associations, Whistler never can play upon another with as much pleasure, for it had been his solace after weariness during 15 years &amp; had twice crossed the Atlantic with him!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-148-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-148">148</a></span></span> it seemed really that the thief had considered more to vex us than to enrich himself. for had I been asked what I would most readily relinquish of all my goods &amp; chattels the Escrotoire would have been the last superfluity I should have parted from. I shall always retain however the sweet emotions my dear Debos affectionate note awakened on Christmas morning &amp; the delighted countenances of Jemmy &amp; Willie can always remain while memory lasts. They are almost consoled for my loss by having Alexander (our first footman who was deprived of his place by a fit of pride refusing to go behind the carriage) back again, as their father has been advised to discharge Maurice &amp; also our poor Feodore. Our new Dvanick is a much more civilized looking creature &amp; as his brother has for years been a faithful servant to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-149-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-149">149</a></span></span> we must hope it will all prove for the best. as I profess to believe every event ordered for good, tho it is more difficult for us apply<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-150-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-150">150</a></span></span> this wholesome maxim to every day trifles. We recognize the Invisible hand which guides all things in life &amp; death, and we kiss the rod because we are assured our heavenly Father does not <span class="CharOverride-1">willingly</span> bereave us, it <span class="CharOverride-1">must then be for our good!</span> &amp; Oh we are secure that we have fallen into the hands of God &amp; not of man — happy for us would it be that we should in every day vexations — which apparently spring only from the ground — also possess our souls in patience.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-151-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-151">151</a></span></span> My dear husband has had a very severe cold ever since he went that sledge ride to visit Col Melnikoff. he has suffered so much from pain in his chest &amp; cough, my hands &amp; heart have both been entirely occupied with care about him.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">January 1844. On the 1<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span> or New Years day according to Russian style (tho the 13<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>of new style) we welcomed a letter from Stonington, the envelope contained one from Julie to Debo as usual whic[h] was the best of all New Years offerings, tho short it was the echo of her fondest affections — And there was also one to me from my own dear Sister Kate with such blessed accounts of her own home I felt my heart bound to meet her there, &amp; her pen brought more vividly than ever before my minds eye all of the dear ones at Marias, but I was even more grateful to her for the minuteness of her account of the interment of those precious remains we had sent from us two months before<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-152-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-152">152</a></span></span> to find a grave with our departed Kirkie. To some it might seem unimportant, yet to us it is pleasant that death cannot divide these our two youngest darlings Kirkie &amp; Charlie who loved each other so entirely. they shall mingle! their redeemed spirits now mingle! they are one in Christ — And so shall we all be if we can only give ourselves up to Him. How infatuated we are when we ever lose sight of the end for which we were created! Oh may we grow in grace &amp; in the knowledge of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jesus Christ! that when each of us must pass thro the valley of the shadow of death,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-153-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-153">153</a></span></span> the hope of going to Him may support us. My precious little Charlies own Mary was very thankful to hear that her darlings body had been deposited where she might if spared to return to America, visit it. I am also very much relieved of anxiety on her own account since she has lately offered to wait our movements here, I was always pained to listen to her proposal to leave us to rejoin her brothe[r]<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-154-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-154">154</a></span></span> for Mary has seemed a part of our own family since Charlie loved her so fondly &amp; I have fervently prayed that God would direct her in her choice whether to go or stay as would be for her good, for I would not selfishly urge her making a sacrifice of her own feelings to mine. How many there are bound up in my heart of hearts with my Angel baby! all who knew him loved him, thus I trust he may become to many a <span class="CharOverride-1">visible</span> object to lead affections to the Eternal source of Love — his cousin Mary<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-155-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-155">155</a></span></span> who had delighted in him last summer will never forget the music of Charlies voice, she wept on the 6<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>of Nov — at his grave. but Oh may she not sorrow as those without hope, tho I trust she will retain the lesson how evanescent are all earthly enjoyments. And my beloved Mother!

As I sat next my host he conversed more with me of his home in Kentucky than he had done before &amp; as he alluded to his trial in losing three children in one week by scarlet fever,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-176-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-176">176</a></span></span> I thought how few in the court circle would suspect he had such a vein of feeling — he usually appears so light &amp; gay — When his health was drank by his guests, he recovered his usual tone of pleasantry &amp; joked upon his being age. 21, and rising! the Col is certainly a young looking Grandfather, for his hair is not grey &amp; his ivory is sound — yet he served under Gen Harrison during our late war.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-177-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-177">177</a></span></span> while I only remember the illumination of 1815 as a child in New York<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-178-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-178">178</a></span></span> tho I suppose the Col judges me quite his contemporary, for he one day offered me his glass. my eye sight does not begin to fail yet,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-179-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-179">179</a></span></span> tho at 39 I have many a silvery hair to warn me of old Times noiseless flight — But of this said dinner party. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Bodisco wore a green velvet with short sleeves, her round fair arms bound round by three bracelets &amp; a weighty necklace of pearls fastened with a very large rich locket of diamonds. I must confess I am not fond of seeing young persons who need no borrowed ornaments, so lavish of them, her teeth are pearls &amp; her brow so smooth &amp; fair, and if she were intellectual her eyes would be more sparkling than diamonds, for she seems perfectly amiable &amp; is so frank she does not even hesitate to say she likes Russian society better than that of her own country &amp; every night is glad to be in ball rooms or theatre,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-180-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-180">180</a></span></span> the Bodiscos<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-181-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-181">181</a></span></span> left the Cols when it was time to go to another party. but the Laws seemed inclined not to go so soon. &amp; as our pastor is the promoter of sociability he collected the young folks around him &amp; seemed to afford them much merriment.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-182-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-182">182</a></span></span> after tea was finished we understood the Col had an engagement for the evening so we returned home by ten. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell came up to our parlor where we had a cheerful chat about our native land. then he asked Debo if it was too late for music, she sung several songs at his request &amp; I felt we need never go from our own roof for recreation, tho the Col had been exceedingly kind &amp; hospitable, indeed had procured a piano &amp; had it tuned purposely that his favorite Miss Debo should play upon it. but she was not required to sustain the whole obligation of yeilding the gallant Col sweet sounds for his politeness &amp; forethought in providing the instrument. Our pastor is musical &amp; joined with his daughters in singing Russian songs. When Debo sung Chorny-Tsvayts<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-183-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-183">183</a></span></span> she surprised M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Law by her correct pronunciation, but this is all the Russ she knows.</p>

Although my life is a retired one I have many demands upon my time, for Debo is often in a bustle of preparation &amp; requires her mothers assistance. The marriages in the Imperial family (of young Grand Duchess Alexandra youngest daughter of the present Emperor to the young prince Fredric of Hesse — &amp; of the Grand Duchess Elizabeth (daughter of Grand Duke Michel) to the Duke of Nassau)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-185-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-185">185</a></span></span> will long be remembered by my children, as these important events were much talked of by some of our visiters &amp; we had a succession of ringing of bells firing of cannons &amp; illuminations for a whole week — Of course the ceremonies were very splendid at the Winter Palace — our friend Maxwell had described the betrothals,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-186-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-186">186</a></span></span> but poor fellow he took so severe a cold at the nuptials of Alexandra<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-187-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-187">187</a></span></span> on Sunday that he is yet quite ill<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-188-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-188">188</a></span></span> — the following Wednesday — being 19<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>of January Russian style — Debo accompanied Emma Maingy &amp; some other ladies to be a spectator of the wedding festivities of the royal cousin Elizabeth,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-189-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-189">189</a></span></span> her father was rather ashamed that his Yankee girl should condescend to mingle even in a fashionable crowd to be a looker on upon an assemblage she could not be received in, but his <span class="CharOverride-1">Indian</span> pride<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-190-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-190">190</a></span></span> does not descend to his children, for Jemmie tried to persuade Mother to avail of a ticket M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Bodisco pressed upon my acceptance &amp; Debo did not complain of the fatigue of standing from noon till night to gaze upon the Emperor, Empress the court &amp; all its splendor. royal brides &amp; all! In the dining hall there were three tables spread that with service of gold for the Imperial family, the other two had silver services, but Debo looked very much exhausted when she came home &amp; we should have been sorry if she had expressed any wish to go again the next evening to gaze upon the dancers at the ball at the Winter Palace. when tickets were brought by young Giraffeski<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-191-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-191">191</a></span></span> for her — the Trouvelliers<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-192-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-192">192</a></span></span> had promised to come to our house &amp; our kind neighbours the Ropes too came over, for then we had not become alarmed about our friend Maxwell as we became soon after — M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> T. is the finest pianist I ever heard, listening to her was a treat &amp; especially so to Debo &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes, it was music of a peculiar kind like liquid strains of soft &amp; rich melody, she seemed also to enjoy Debos harp &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes singing &amp; at the close of the evening gave a most ludicrous report of the crowd at the Palace where she had been induced to go on her way to us. I could only understand by her gestures that she was fortunate in having escaped without losing her sleeves or other parts of her dress! thus Debo congratulated herself that she could join in the laugh without being torn to peices herself.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-193-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-193">193</a></span></span> But I think it was the last merry mood our dear girl was in for some days, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell became so dangerously ill that we all sympathised in the grief we feared awaited his parents, our boys walked on tip toe lest they might disturb one whom they love so fondly, Whistler sat up night after night with him &amp; every moment he could steal from his duties during the day he spent at the bed side of his young countryman.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-194-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-194">194</a></span></span> This day a week ago<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-195-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-195">195</a></span></span> was the crisis of his fever, his symptoms alarmed even D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Rogers,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-196-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-196">196</a></span></span> who called in a consulting physician.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-197-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-197">197</a></span></span> I ventured often into the room for the patient was delirious &amp; could not be annoyed by it,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-198-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-198">198</a></span></span> this night week Fairbanks was with Whistler beside him, when I came up stairs after 12 oclock I feared I might not find M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell living, my anxiety roused me before day light, I made a hasty toilette &amp; went down. Oh how cheered I was on entering the ante room at the sight of Whistler &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Fairbanks taking a cup of tea which Le Ron<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-199-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-199">199</a></span></span> had just prepared them, &amp; I returned with the good report to Debo that a favorable change had occurred during the night &amp; the young countryman in whom we all felt interested we hoped would be spared to make one of our fire side again &amp; to realize his wish to return to his native New York again — but I considered he had been on the verge of eternity &amp; I earnestly prayed that he might experience that sense of the mercy of God in prolonging his life as would lead him to devote it to His honor &amp; glory.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-200-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-200">200</a></span></span> The sunday after M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell was seized with the brain fever which has thus reduced him my James was quite poorly as he occasionally has been since his illness of last year, I therefore staid from church to read to him, Mary took little Willie &amp; on their return they had so much to relate of the sudden death of old Admiral Hall!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-201-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-201">201</a></span></span> We had heard his absence from his seat remarked since Christmas for he was one of those would have thought it a privilige to be even “a door keeper in the house of God”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-202-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-202">202</a></span></span> but he was very aged &amp; had been ill. Col Todd has always occupied the same pew with him, &amp; as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Law was not yet in the desk they had exchanged a friendly greeting, the aged christian telling our Ambassador that tho his wife &amp; daughter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-203-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-203">203</a></span></span> deemed it rather imprudent in him to go out his great desire had overcome their advice. for he added “I have been absent from church two Sundays! The service soon after commenced with the morning hymn, the good old man stood &amp; praised God among the congregation until that verse (which I have always thought so elevating to the soul) “Wake &amp; lift up thyself my heart, And with the Angels bear thy part”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-204-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-204">204</a></span></span> when he suddenly fell dead against Col Todd! tho most there supposed he had only swooned, no doubt his spirit was instantly among that blissful company “Who all night long, unwearied sing, Glory to Thee, Eternal King!”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-205-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-205">205</a></span></span> I went to church on the day of the old Admirals funeral,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-206-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-206">206</a></span></span> there were only a few ladies, but a crowd of military, all with badges of mourning. the body covered with a purple &amp; gold pall before the altar. Our service is so peculiarly solemn I hoped many might understand &amp; feel it. Even the horses which drew the hearse were covered with black cloth as was the family coach the procession was preceded by men carrying flambeaus. Last Sunday M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Laws text was “dust thou art &amp; unto death shalt thou return”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-207-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-207">207</a></span></span> he alluded to the event of the sabbath before &amp; the example of that soldier of Christ, urging us also to be ready, for who among us would be next called &amp; how soon! is of thrilling import, the old admiral was long in the service of this country tho a Scotchman<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-208-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-208">208</a></span></span> by birth. His daughter sat in the pew with me, she wept during all the service &amp; I observed when we all rose to join in the morning hymn, she knelt. Col Todd the other day was remarking on the excellent character of Admiral Hall &amp; added he had avoided mentioning his death in writing to his own family lest they might be led to fear the like sudden call for himself as the other occupant of that pew died as suddenly last May! and Sir Ker Porter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-209-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-209">209</a></span></span> was in the prime of life, he was brother to the Authoresses A-M &amp; Jane Porter,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-210-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-210">210</a></span></span> had just made his arrangements for returning to England when returning from court he fell dead at the door of his own house!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-211-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-211">211</a></span></span> The Col certainly looks as tho he would go on the even tenor of his way a long while yet, for tho he is nightly at entertainments he is decidedly temperate in every way &amp; looks as tho he could sing “be gone dull care”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-212-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-212">212</a></span></span> he certainly strives to render unto all their claims upon him, regularly attends the Episcopal service in the morning, the Presbyterian in the evening<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-213-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-213">213</a></span></span> after which he pays his respects at the Count Nesselrodes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-214-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-214">214</a></span></span> where there is always a Sunday night soiree, but the Col does not so far forget the sacred season as to make one at the card tables, tho gambling is the favorite recreation, the Col attends the French theatre<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-215-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-215">215</a></span></span> for the language &amp; the company he meets there, the Italian Opera<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-216-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-216">216</a></span></span> because music is his passion! &amp; the Palace on any day the Emperor signifies it to be his wish for in the court circle he is <span class="CharOverride-1">upon duty</span> as the Ambassador of his country, but he whispers to his countrymen there is a dreadful wear &amp; tear of conscience &amp; he wishes his office could be changed for one tending to the interests of a better world! <span class="CharOverride-1">I</span> think in whatsoever situation we are placed we may by self denial &amp; a holy resolution honor God, who orders our sphere of action to try us whether we love Him better than all else. but I do not condemn those who act differently from my views &amp; have no merit in declining amusements which I could not enjoy. But Oh I tremble for my children “the snares of the world” are so enticing until proved by christian experience that they are destructive to our love of Christ, and the young are slow to turn from the “voice of the charmer” whose reasonings are so plausible while tempting them to enjoy pleasure while they may for the dark days come so soon!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-217-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-217">217</a></span></span> thus enticing them into scenes where they forget the divine presence of Him who has told us <span class="CharOverride-1">to be known</span> as His disciples in the world.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-218-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-218">218</a></span></span> My dear Debo may compare her rational domestic career with the dissipation of the youth of this gay metropolis &amp; feel satisfied that she may <span class="CharOverride-1">sometimes</span> attend a french play or the Opera without injury to herself, but Oh how much more happy she would be if she found no pleasure in them! she is a dear, amiable child, dutiful &amp; always cheerful, yeilding to her fathers views of what is right, and already a favorite in the English circle here, the influence of a perfectly amiable young person, so gifted as she is might be so impressive in society with decided christian obligations, that I am too apt to lament that my dear daughter does not realize that she is required by her vows as one of Christs little flock to “let her light shine”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-219-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-219">219</a></span></span> that those who are in error may be led into the way of truth, but Debo does not think with me on this subject, &amp; I know that it must be wisdom from above which can convince her. I wish to be patient &amp; to cast my care upon God. On monday last she was to have gone to a ball at the Hall of the Noblesse<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-220-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-220">220</a></span></span> where the presence of the Imperial family &amp; all the court would make a splendid scene of novelty to charm her, but when Col Bouttattz<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-221-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-221">221</a></span></span> came soon after breakfast with tickets for the Opera &amp; her father gave her the choice of the morning or the evening amusement she decided to give up the ball, so at 1 oclock they went &amp; returned at our usual dinner hour four oclock, very much gratified with the Barber of Seville,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-222-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-222">222</a></span></span> in the meantime I had gone out in a sledge under M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes care to a German jewellers<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-223-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-223">223</a></span></span> to shew my dear Debo that tho I would not advocate her fondness for public amusements I yet enjoyed contributing my mite to please her. I selected a very pretty gold chain, which I was glad suited her taste when I presented it on her return home, she needed one to guard the pretty glasses her indulgent father had bought her some days before, &amp; his approval of my additional purchase more than repaid me for venturing out in such a severe frost. It was 12 degrees below zero, yet I must confess I do not suffer from cold wrapped in my fox skin. The Ropes came in sociably to tea that evening thinking they might see Debo (whom they love &amp; admire equally) dressed for the grand ball, but she could not have been better satisfied there than she seemed at the piano or harp with M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Rs accompaniment, until eleven oclock when they partook of some fruit &amp; bade us good night. We all feel more cheerful since M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell is convalescing, tho it is slowly,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-224-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-224">224</a></span></span> he still has some friend to watch by his bed side every night — Joseph Ropes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-225-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-225">225</a></span></span> is there now. Debo &amp; her father came from M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Laws soirée just at 12. the party would not probably break up till 3. our folks were there just two hours, Debo found it pleasant dancing yet she expressed no desire to linger when her father proposed to leave. how much I admire her amiability she does not know! &amp; surely she will retain the good opinion of those who revel longer, for moderation wins respect. The day before this ball at our parsons we went to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maingys<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-226-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-226">226</a></span></span> to dine at 5 1/2, they are not fond of parties so we only met two gentlemen, Miss Grant<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-227-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-227">227</a></span></span> whom we know thro M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Baird<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-228-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-228">228</a></span></span> joined us at tea, she had invited herself that she might hear Miss W- play again! while the young ladies were in the music room I had some pleasing conversation with M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʀ</span> Maingy<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-229-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-229">229</a></span></span> who is truly pious, we talked of our departed little ones!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-230-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-230">230</a></span></span> of our churches &amp; pastors in England &amp; America,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-231-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-231">231</a></span></span> it was a treat to me to listen to the opinion of one who expressed the undivided interest I feel in the Saviours kingdom. We afterwards went together to the sleeping apartments of her little Lily &amp; Freddy.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-232-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-232">232</a></span></span> he is between my boys in years &amp; very fond of them. I did not wonder when I saw his play room that they should like a day on the Island so much, their rooms all communicate as is common in Russian houses numerous &amp; small so that each of the girls have a separate establishment boudoir &amp; all! Eliza<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-233-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-233">233</a></span></span> is most interesting to me, but I admire Emma<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-234-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-234">234</a></span></span> who is perhaps most talented &amp; is very pretty. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Maingy reminds me of my dear Brother Winny, in looks &amp; character, he seems also to appreciate Debo as that kind Uncle did when we were in England. This was the coldest weather we have had this winter, I heard of many frost bitten faces! but really in these warm houses one can hardly be aware of the extreme changes. the days are lengthening rapidly almost 12 hours day light now, how cheering to me for I feel how little I accomplish. This is the week of the Carnival or <span class="CharOverride-1">butter week</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-235-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-235">235</a></span></span> as the Russians call it as they eat no meat now, in anticipation of Lent, but how strange their inconsistency, their eagerness for amusement because they are to be deprived of it for forty days proves they must think it is a season of penance instead of one of improvement. Architects have been very busy in erecting temporary theatres, swings, ice hills &amp;c in the Admiralty Square<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-236-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-236">236</a></span></span> that <span class="CharOverride-1">all classes</span> may enjoy recreations this week, while the Opera has become a <span class="CharOverride-1">morning</span> revel this week, that the higher classes may devote the evenings to balls. The Col sent us tickets for a masked ball to be given at the Palace, ’tis the only occasion upon which the Emperor descends from his dignity to exchange words with <span class="CharOverride-1">the people</span> who may gain admittance, of course even Debos curiosity would not take her into such a mixed crowd altho the strictest decorum is observed even in public places here &amp; of course at the Imperial Palace<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-237-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-237">237</a></span></span> — On the night of M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Laws soirée there was also a great ball at the Palace of the Grand Duke Michel given in honor of his daughters marriage,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-238-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-238">238</a></span></span> many wore costumes, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Bodiscos cost $1000. Col Todd had not reached the English Quay when Debo &amp; her father p<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> their parting compliments – but he had promised the Laws to be there at midnight, for the Imperial family keep early hours &amp; for the Empres’s health<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-239-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-239">239</a></span></span> eight oclock is the hour for receiving, wherever she goes. so that the Col would find the night still in its meridian when the court should release him &amp; could pay his devoirs in the English circle after twelve. How thankful I feel that our dear Debo is satisfied with a moderate participation in these things!</p>

We had hoped the mail which came in yesterday from England would have brought us intelligence by the Steamer of the l<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>but too soon! we are too impatient! Oh what a vast obligation is ours to the poor mail driver! &amp; to those brave mariners too who endure such hardships at this season of the year to bring us comforts! The extreme cold of the past fortnight has made me reflect deeply on the great difference in the lot of individuals of the vast human family. We within our heated mansions would be scarcely conscious how severe the atmosphere without but for our thermometers or the reports we listen to from those who ask our commiseration for the suffering poor. Such real Russian winter has not been experienced in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg in many years. Sledges have arrived from the country with driver &amp; in some cases <span class="CharOverride-1">all</span> frozen to death. Postillions found stiff &amp; dead seated upon their masters equipages! Ah how can the rich reconcile it to themselves that their idleness &amp; frivolity should so condemn their retainers to sudden death. that <span class="CharOverride-1">pride</span> may be gratified while their coach &amp; four stop the way. God will bring them to judgement! those who delight in mercy shall obtain mercy”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-242-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-242">242</a></span></span> may my children abide by the golden rule in every circumstance of their life. We have kept at home for a week, 30 deg below zero being too keen an atmosphere for a drive or a walk, but the sun shone brightly after the snow fell every day. Our pastor M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Law &amp; his ladies called yesterday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-243-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-243">243</a></span></span> the cold having moderated, they mentioned upwards of 30 persons had been found dead from cold in this quarter alone last week 3 at the guard posts just at our corner. Ah the sad question! were <span class="CharOverride-1">any</span> prepared to meet their Saviour? will solemnly obtrude as we listen to these melancholy accidents! That we are not removed from liability to sudden death within our comfortable homes must be often felt, for many have been the cases among the higher orders which we hear their associates lament, tho they seem not to lay it to heart. Last evening we had a few friends to join us at tea. Their two Excellencies Col Todd &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Bodisco — with our beautiful young countrywoman. I listened to their remarks upon the <span class="CharOverride-1">last ball</span> they had attended in the court circle &amp; learnt the host then so full of health &amp; spirits died of a fit at the age of 45 last Sunday!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-244-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-244">244</a></span></span> We cannot judge of the heart, but Oh what comfort to surviving relatives when our lives bear testimony to our faith in Jesus. And alas in this gay city the <span class="CharOverride-1">many</span> appear not to live as tho they loved Him better than the world. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʀ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Bodisco spoke in raptures of the uninterrupted seasons of pleasure she has participated in at this dissipated court, &amp; said she should never wish to return to her native land if she had her own relatives here — no society in America she says<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-245-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-245">245</a></span></span> — she must have lost relish for what is rational &amp; intellectual &amp; sincere! Oh I can think of no earthly delight to compare with that of our return to our native land! As I anticipate our approach to a sight of its shores within the beautiful harbor of New York or Boston I am afraid of growing too impatient to realize all this fond dream! but she thinks after having visited Niagara there is nothing more to induce even an American to desire ever to return there! She wants the patriotism of our little boys, who exalt their native land above all other countries upon Earth. I allowed them to remain in the parlor an hour after their usual bedtime last night for our favorite Miss Khremmer (who had won their hearts on our voyage upon the Bullie) was among us, Col Bouttattz also &amp; Melnikoff. I was not sorry I indulged my darling boys. they behaved so like gentlemen their father commended them today upon it. Jemmie was part the evening <span class="CharOverride-1">enjoying the Spy</span> to <span class="CharOverride-1">himself</span>, I watched him laughing so heartily yet quietly over some of Ceasers speeches<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-246-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-246">246</a></span></span> I could scarcely refrain from joining in it. While Debo collected the circle of amateurs around her piano M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Ropes aiding her with her fine voice I sat with M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Bodisco who has so little ear for music she did not even recognise our national air Yankee Doodle<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-247-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-247">247</a></span></span> when played, &amp; seemed to like her seat on the sofa too well to leave it. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes regaled her with some histories of Russian depredations,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-248-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-248">248</a></span></span> but afterwards as she unconsciously tossed about a few elegant little volumes on the sofa=table upon which she leaned her snowy arm, she discovered they were all on religious subjects, which induced her to tell me she had an extensive library of religious works at my service, they had been parting gifts from her pastor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-249-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-249">249</a></span></span> on her bidding adieu to him, but she shrugged her shoulders &amp; said she had never time to look into them. all her reading now must of necessity be in french as that is the language at court! When she afterwards described to me the death of her infant so suddenly taken from her on the day of her fathers funeral<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-250-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-250">250</a></span></span> too, just as she was packing up to leave Georgetown, I wondered she should not have sought comfort in these good books on her long voyage. I certainly shall borrow them that I may recommend their perusal to her! Miss Khremmer staid later than the others &amp; was delighted with our Indian portraits.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-251-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-251">251</a></span></span> I told her how glad I was we had anything to shew her which she had not met with in her travels. she is so sensible &amp; agreeable she reminds me of my dear Charleston Cousins.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-252-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-252">252</a></span></span> Debo has been spending today on the Island. I am always willing to spare her to the Maingys, much tho I miss her dear self from my side, I know she is delighting &amp; delighted there, such companions will give her a distaste for those are less improved. I returned by her a book which Miss M had lent me &amp; have been deeply interested in perusing it. Blunt upon the Epistles to the 7 churches of Asia from Rev:<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-253-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-253">253</a></span></span> I read sometimes to Whistler just at bedtime in it, &amp; last Sunday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-254-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-254">254</a></span></span> evening he gratified me by asking me to read a whole lecture which I did with all my heart! God bless him &amp; teach us together by His spirit to enjoy such studies. how <span class="CharOverride-1">secure</span> the family union where such subjects are understood &amp; prefered! My dear husband is now reading beside me. since his french tutor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-255-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-255">255</a></span></span> has left him free, we are momentarily expecting Debo, it is nearly ten, but as M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Gellebrand<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-256-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-256">256</a></span></span> was to bring her in their sledge she waits her movements no doubt. My darling Willie was thrown out of a sledge yesterday, Jemmie more active swung himself off. In such cases the driver in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg always drives off lest the Police should deprive him of vehicle &amp; horse for his carelessness.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-257-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-257">257</a></span></span> my boys were persuaded by Alexander the poor Swashdic<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-258-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-258">258</a></span></span> should not be p<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> (tho Willie confessed they had gone the worth of 50 kopeeks silver)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-259-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-259">259</a></span></span> &amp; they seemed to deem it quite a proper revenge for the bruises he was the cause of to little Willie, that he went off without his pay, until I pointed out to them their dishonesty. all today they have been urging me to send them up the Galernia to compensate the poor driver for breaking his sledge. but snow has been incessantly falling until tonight, they describe the roads like waves of the sea out of the city, such heavy falls of snow are not usual here, we have this winter had heretofore a little snow every day light &amp; fine like dust, &amp; have not minded walking out in them. I drove with M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gellebrand as far as the Gastinandva<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-260-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-260">260</a></span></span> in a snow storm which in America would be a sufficient embargo to keep ladies in the house, but had secured from cold by furs, I really enjoyed it, tho I had a great deal to shake off when I reached our own vestibule again. My errand had been to have a black satin dress fitted, &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> G had gone very kindly gone to talk Russ with the mantua maker<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-261-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-261">261</a></span></span> for me. It has since been finished &amp; I do not think it dear, silk lining for Cardinal,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-262-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-262">262</a></span></span> rich gymp<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-263-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-263">263</a></span></span> &amp;c &amp;c 50 rubles paper,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-264-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-264">264</a></span></span> about 10 dollars. I could find no bombazine<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-265-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-265">265</a></span></span> at the English Magazine which is the great shop here the satin cost me about as much as the making &amp; trimmings, &amp; as there was not attempt at a bargain I suppose it was a fair price.I must record the 1<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span> day of March this year tho the 12<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> has arrived, but on that morning Debo &amp; I had some exquisite enjoyment in listening to the choristers of the Imperial Palace, she because the music was so perfect of its kind &amp; she could speak her delight to Emma Maingy who sat next her, &amp; I — when I closed my eyes against the crowd, could imagine myself among those who sing heavenly hallilujahs. <span class="CharOverride-1">all</span> all that have gone before me seemed to be near enough for me to hear &amp; see their bliss! &amp; my heart was so full I wept. It is not unusual for persons to be quite overcome by this choir of boys, their choruses are such perfect melody, but the solos are most melting! little fellows from the size of our little Willie stood in front &amp; so the size uniformly increased up to manhood. there is an asylum appropriated to them for their education &amp; home.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-266-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-266">266</a></span></span> at the end of an hour the rehearsal was over, &amp; on our way out to our sledges we saw their school rooms, &amp; the apartment where their dinner tables were already set. Emma pointed out decanters of Quass (a sour but favorite Russian beverage)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-267-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-267">267</a></span></span> several on each long table. the boys looked as if they would be glad when we should let them take their seats. they had been standing so very erect, for that hour, but tho Whistler allowed his imagination to embitter his pleasure in listening to them by the idea of how they must be dulled &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">punished</span>!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-268-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-268">268</a></span></span> the home looked comfortable &amp; their countenances happy. Emma came the next Sat<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-269-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-269">269</a></span></span> to spend the day &amp; practise at our house with Debo, she brought me a favorite volume from her mother who was right in her assurance that I should enjoy it. “Reads meditations.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-270-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-270">270</a></span></span> I am told he died last Sum<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ơ</span> in his native land England, he surely was in the full faith of our blessed Saviour &amp; Oh may many be led by this work to esteem the knowledge of Christ as they ought, I shewed Emma an American prayer book,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-271-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-271">271</a></span></span> as some one had misinformed them about the service of our church in my dear country. they had heard that we were not allowed to use a written form of prayer she admired the hymns exceedingly, in the English chapel here we have such a meagre collection of hymns &amp; no chaunts sung – I often think over the devotion of the singing in the Westerly church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-272-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-272">272</a></span></span> &amp; wish here it was so! Since I last wrote upon the incidents of this Winter, we have heard from Stonington. no letter addressed to myself by the steamer of the l<span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>of Feb but one from dear Kate Prince<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-273-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-273">273</a></span></span> written in Dec, in sympathy for my loss in our darling Charlies death. what a treat it was to get it! I have so often thought of this warm hearted girl &amp; really longed to hear from her. I had written her a few lines by the last mail in the hope she might go to Boston to see M Harrison<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-274-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-274">274</a></span></span> who is to leave there next month to join her husband here. My dear brother W<span class="CharOverride-9U">ms</span> letter to Whistler<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-275-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-275">275</a></span></span> was all I could wish, so cheerful, so confiding &amp; so affectionate, his mention of our precious mothers welfare with Charles<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-276-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-276">276</a></span></span> caused my heart to lift itself up in thankfulness to God! I had had distressing dreams of Mother &amp; her long silence is such a blank, that I began feel [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] “all else availed little”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-277-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-277">277</a></span></span> till I could be assured she was well. Debo had letters not only from her “Twin” but from Eliza Van Vee I entered into the interesting details of each &amp; it was my painful duty that night to disclose to my dear husband the death of his brother James.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-278-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-278">278</a></span></span> At this distance from all our natural ties how striking is the knell which sounds upon our hearts at such tidings. Oh may the warning be not lost upon us! how many have departed since Whistler left his country less than two years ago! And who of us may be summoned next becomes a startling question — The news of dear cousin Carri was truly gratifying this she calls the happy winter of her life — she is so thankful that she can walk again without crutches — and so blessed in her restored husband &amp; snug home.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-279-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-279">279</a></span></span> May God see fit long to continue this peace of mind to her &amp; may her life shew forth her praise! for unless we appreciate every blessing as from the true source, it is lost upon us.</p>

I finished my despatches on tuesday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-292-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-292">292</a></span></span> for the next Steamer and also wrote my Sister Alicia by that days Courier. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Harrison<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-293-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-293">293</a></span></span> had preceded it a week, by him I sent a few Russian slippers &amp; gew gaws to our young friends &amp; we managed to slip in a Russian puzzle<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-294-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-294">294</a></span></span> for Johnny Chapman<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-295-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-295">295</a></span></span> from Willie which is a great secret between him &amp; I! for Father objected lest it should trouble M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> H. but he loves to gratify children &amp; he proposed putting the box in his own trunk <span class="CharOverride-1">privately</span>. We have heard of the travellers as far as Berlin.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-296-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-296">296</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> H will be relieved when he exchanges the Kabitka<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-297-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-297">297</a></span></span> for a Steamer, when he set out from this with a lady inside with himself, he could not have anticipated much ease, no room even to sit up, as persons are expected to recline in these covered sledges when travelling &amp; to sleep all the way that is the only provision made. he will enjoy his return to Russia I trust, bringing wife &amp; children,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-298-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-298">298</a></span></span> what a transition from Winters snows, to Summers verdure! but he will experience that first in England. How cheering the long bright days are beginning to be here, we heed not the solid &amp; interminable white pavement, for the sky looks benignly — &amp; until 7 oclock I enjoy my work or book by day light — I send Mary with Willie to take a stroll now <span class="CharOverride-1">after</span> dinner as it is necessary to take the fresh air regularly, for health, they reported this evening the rebuilding the temporary theatres &amp;c in the Admiralty Square, in anticipation of Easter, when the people are to throng there for a weeks holiday again.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-299-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-299">299</a></span></span> the secret of pulling them down during Lent, I am told is, that the proprietors may thus be obliged to afford work to the mechanics, whose families probably squander their hard earnings in these shows. The Emperor interest in the welfare of his people is very fair where he can judge for himself of what will be just. for instance there is now a bridge building across the Neva,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-300-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-300">300</a></span></span> which it is so essential to have finished before the ice breaks up,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-301-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-301">301</a></span></span> that the mechanics upon it work all night and all day. We observed them busy one sunday on our way to church &amp; so did the Emperor I presume (for he is daily driving about the city in his one horse sledge pretending to be nothing greater than any other military man whose uniform he wears<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-302-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-302">302</a></span></span> – for an order was issued forbidding the work on the bridge on the Sabbath. It is well there is moonlight for the poor fellows, my Willie said to me as we walked on the English quay &amp; I remarked to him how hard they toiled, while they sung a kind of sea song, “Dont you think mother the poor must be glad that God said there should be one day of rest in every week” Indeed our heavenly parent who knows the eagerness of humanity for worldly advantages knew <span class="CharOverride-1">we</span> should never reserve any time to prepare ourselves for eternity. &amp; He has provided all things for our comfort if we will but have confidence in His wisdom &amp; love for us <span class="CharOverride-1">his children</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">March 29<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> friday evening. Debo has gone with Miss Khremer to the Michel Theatre<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-303-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-303">303</a></span></span> this eve to a concert at which the wonderful Pianist Clara V<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-304-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-304">304</a></span></span> is to perform, as my dear daughter had a fine opportunity for listening to her performance a few days ago when she visited the Smoloff institution<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-305-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-305">305</a></span></span> with the Maingays, I was the more chagrined that she went tonight, for I cannot think it consistent with a communicant of our church &amp; in Lent too — to give countenance to theatres, but Debo knows my opinion, so I say nothing only my heart is pained when our views are opposite. Ah how thankful I feel at this moment for the comfort my precious Mothers<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-306-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-306">306</a></span></span> yeilds me! &amp; one from dear Maria too so circumstantial that I can almost imagine myself by her side. how thrilling her account of little Georgy Palmers<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-307-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-307">307</a></span></span> illness! May dear Kate be taught that the children God has given her are from a garden of paradise — not hers — but lent for her comfort, &amp; to be recalled at any moment. Even in this world there is one place at which our souls all meet even which [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>]<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-308-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-308">308</a></span></span> seas roll between us, at the footstool of mercy. Oh what could comfort us as faith in prayer does! how earnestly do I daily ask the blessing of our Saviour on <span class="CharOverride-1">all</span> I love, most especially upon my dear George &amp; upon my Mother, &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">He</span> is already granting my urgent request that she may be an instrument of good by example &amp; precept leading many to Him. I can no longer regret her not coming to Russia — tho I wish for her dear society every day — it was mercifully ordered that she should go to my dear brother Charles &amp; Oh may all her endeavours for his comfort be rewarded by his following in the footsteps of such a mother.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-309-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-309">309</a></span></span> Debo will be so glad when she comes in presently to find a letter from her Twin for her — We were dissappointed that our budget<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-310-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-310">310</a></span></span> did not come early in the week — When the Galignani<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-311-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-311">311</a></span></span> informed us of the arrival of the Hibernia at Liverpool in 12 days from Boston — we then read the awful account of the exploding the great gun on board the Princeton at Washington &amp; so suddenly taking the lives of the Sec of the Navy. the Sec of State &amp; four other persons.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-312-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-312">312</a></span></span> &amp; I have reflected much upon the providence of God which has in the past year, twice sheilded our dear Donald Fairfax<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-313-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-313">313</a></span></span> from injury when exposed to death, for I presume he must be attached to this man of War — I trust his precious life may be prolonged on Earth to shine on the narrow path &amp; induce his young companions to join him in it &amp; as a blessing &amp; comfort to us all. How much anxiety are we saved when those we love shew in their daily conduct that their devotion to the Saviour exceeds their love of earthly attractions, a feeling of <span class="CharOverride-1">security</span> attends all my fond reveries of Donald. I must not omit recording our visiting the Gastinandva today. Col Bottatz [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] was our pilot thro the crowd of purchasers &amp; venders of artificial flowers, images &amp;c in anticipation of Palm-Sunday.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-314-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-314">314</a></span></span> this business has been most active all this week. Our dear boys were quite excited by the novelty of the scene, James animation attracted the wonder of many, for even in crowds here such decorum &amp; gravity prevails that it must be surprising when there is any ebullition of joy.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-315-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-315">315</a></span></span> Willie <span class="CharOverride-1">bargained</span> for a Harmonica &amp; a banner with the Russian Eagle – the latter he wishes he could send to Jacks!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-316-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-316">316</a></span></span> Indeed both with Jemmie &amp; himself usually an “All this availeth me nothing” if Willie Wyatt<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-317-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-317">317</a></span></span> &amp; Jacky could only be with us it would be very well — Whistler gave James a Cosmorama of the Seasons,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-318-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-318">318</a></span></span> which he exhibited to us this evening all lit up. The workmen are busy as they were before Lent rebuilding the temporary theatres-ice hills-&amp;c in the Admiralty Square for Easter holidays. these temporary amusements are called the Catchells<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-319-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-319">319</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">April 10<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>1844. The sound of the poor workmens hammers driving piles for the new bridge across the Neva has been over some days.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-320-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-320">320</a></span></span> I miss their song now when I take my stroll upon the English Quai. the ice must soon break up, for thawing has made rivulets thro out the streets. yet we have had 7 deg of frost at night this week — Last week was Passion-week<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-321-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-321">321</a></span></span> &amp; our church as thronged every day for prayers as any Greek or Roman, we could not even find places in the pews sometimes, but sat around the walls. On Good Friday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-322-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-322">322</a></span></span> I took my dear little Willie by the hand to the house of God, a string of equipages lined the Quai, for many attend even from Cronstadt at this season to receive the Communion. but my dear boy was separated from me by reason of the crowd in the church. I remarked his good behaviour with thankfulness. Debo was in like manner obliged to sit apart from her father, altho we went to the side of the church appropriated to the gents: the sexton would have shewn Whistler the respect of a higher place, but he is inclined in a place of worship to “take the lower room”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-323-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-323">323</a></span></span> &amp; could scarcely retain that from the urgent demand for places, so many young officers attended to receive the holy communion - as all in the service of Russia must of necessity be members of a christian church, &amp; descendants of English parents naturally prefer that of their forefathers.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-324-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-324">324</a></span></span> Debo was invited to go with the Laws to the Kezan<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-325-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-325">325</a></span></span> Church Sat night-to witness the Greek ceremony of hailing Easter, but we objected to her remaining out so long after her usual hour of rest, she has not been well lately - so she merely dined at the Parsonage &amp; when we sent for her at ten she slipped away unnoticed. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes who once had attended the Kezan gave me so minute a description that I can imagine how imposing is the service &amp; shall not brave the dense crowd. Just before midnight the priests form a procession, each bearing some holy vessel of gold &amp; silver from the Altar, they chaunt solemnly as they leave the church ( thro a side door) &amp; after making a circuit out side they re-enter, the people then chaunt tumultuously “Where is Christ” upon which the priests chaunt “He is risen”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-326-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-326">326</a></span></span> instantly every one in that dense crowd hold up a lightered taper, such a sudden change from darkness to light discovers how closely they connect the good things of this life, with their Saviours resurrection. Avenues are formed thro the crowd for spreading out all sorts of food to be blessed by the priest. their fast having been so severe during Passion Week they immediately begin devouring curds, hard eggs &amp;c at midnight — &amp; either owing to this imprudence or the weeks revelling which follows, very many more deaths than usual occur. On Easter Sunday I was induced to rise as early as 5 oclock by M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes coming for me to walk with him to the Catholic church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-327-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-327">327</a></span></span> to hear the mass so beautifully sung there, the morning was clear &amp; mild, I enjoyed the walk very much &amp; was quite compensated for the effort it cost me to follow my guide thro the crowd which <span class="CharOverride-1">filled</span> every corner, it was just 6 oclock when the service began. A kind of martial music of triumph opened it, then the fine toned Organ accompanied the voices of the chaunters After the crowd dispersed we lingered near those who really came there to worship. I observed many prostrate upon the marble pavement, even their foreheads touching it in front of a door, &amp; was told that had represented the holy sepulchre. At each Altar there are confessionals where were priests all in white even with white hoods, engaged in listening to the kneeling penitents whose lips were at the little window towards which they bent their ear, in french, german, or russ, the notice was printed on each stall — On our return thro the Nevski what a contrast all the Fancy shops presented filled with luxuries, but above all the Easter Eggs adorned them, &amp; as we continued our route home thro the Alexandra square<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-328-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-328">328</a></span></span> it was still more shocking to see the preparations for commencing the Easter amusements, men at the booths unpacking refreshments of every kind, mead, cakes, fruit, nuts, but above all colored eggs — banners flying! &amp; all looking as if they, rejoiced that the restraint of Lent was taken off, for it is so strictly observed here that all amusements are prohibited, &amp; during Passion week the Imperial family leave the Winter Palace to seclude themselves some versts from the hum of the city.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-329-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-329">329</a></span></span> I found my family just leaving their rooms, we assembled as usual for reading the scriptures &amp; I read that beautiful prayer for Easter Sunday from the book my Twin Sister had obtained from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W<span class="CharOverride-9">m</span> Hull<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-330-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-330">330</a></span></span> for my use. I felt sorry that custom should infringe <span class="CharOverride-1">in my home</span> upon the sanctity of the day God has consecrated to rest, &amp; if my life is spared to another Easter here I shall put off the exchange of gifts until Easter Monday, as I find they do at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes — But there was the cooks ornamented loaf stuck full of flowers upon the breakfast table — &amp; a small plate of colored eggs from each servant Dvanic, Porter &amp; even M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwells man Le Rong had sent up his, with the motto “Christ is risen” upon some. Alexander had selected the choicest he could buy made of wax or sugur for each of us, so that we felt obliged to present him with 5 silver rubles to repay him, each one giving their proportion to make up the sum. &amp; as I held my ruble for his acceptance he kissed my hand so <span class="CharOverride-1">gracefully</span> as he said in good english “thank you M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Whistler” My heart involuntarily prayed he might become the servant of the only true God. I begged him not to join in any of the amusements in the square on sunday promising him a holiday any other, he seemed sincere in his assurance that he would rather not go there, but to church as usual. I was glad too that our Mary proposed to go with us to the English church.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-331-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-331">331</a></span></span> Willie had his mothers hand again. I love to listen to his remarks in my walks at all times when we are téte a téte, but never more than this morning when he was anticipating the full congregation we were going to meet “Dont you think Mother it is delightful to see a church <span class="CharOverride-1">quite</span> full? I think it is a <span class="CharOverride-1">splendid</span> sight but I should not think so if the people were all Germans like our man Maurice who could not understand M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Law when he went with me to church” “Perhaps if he had Willie, he would have learnt better than to steal.”—— In the afternoon we had no service as administering the communion to such an unusual number had prolonged M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Laws duties. I was at no loss at home, read with my boys &amp; afterwards in “Reades Meditations”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-332-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-332">332</a></span></span> to my dear husband.

We have had some delightful weather this spring &amp; thro the untiring perseverance of the Police upon the poor Dvanics the streets have been entirely cleared of their deep pavement of ice, the power of the sun which shines so bright in this climate, of course caused plenty of mud for a week or so, but the stones are quite clear now thro every thoroughfare. Debo &amp; I had a charming drive this morning up the Nevski in a nice Droshky. little Willy stood up between us &amp; by his attempt at speaking Russ in every shop was not only useful but amusing. today being dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes birth day &amp; also the 4<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> Anniversary of her wedding<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-336-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-336">336</a></span></span> we were in search for some pretty &amp; appropriate offering it being the custom in Russia always to make presents on birthdays (every servants [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] even expects it) Debo could find nothing she liked (not too extravagantly dear but a pen handle at the English Magazine. I had gone as soon as breakfast was over to offer my best wishes of many happy returns of the day. the good young couple looked so truly contented with little Ellen seated in her high chair between Papa and Mama at their morning repast, which they told me had been delayed by M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> R having notes to read &amp; answer, &amp; so many pretty gifts from his brother, Sisters &amp; their own little trio.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-337-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-337">337</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Gellebrands lines were worth all M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> R said for her heart abounds in love to the Saviour &amp; to all around her. We have been invited to meet a party of friends at her house this evening in honor of the anniversary, but as Whistler has a sore throat &amp; our darling James is still confined to his room I shall not be there. We had a very pleasant evenings [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] at the Gellebrands last week &amp; also at the Ropes the departure of the Maingays for England induces us to meet them as often as possible. The same little circle were with us last Wednesday evening,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-338-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-338">338</a></span></span> my only alloy was that Jemmie was confined to his bed, with a mustard plaister on his throat. he has been very poorly since the thawing season commenced, soon becoming overheated takes cold, when he complained of pain first in his shoulder then in his side, my fears of a return of last years attack made me tremble, &amp; when I gaze upon his pale face sleeping, contrasted with Willies round rosy cheeks my heart is full, but I know that our heavenly Father permits it to be thus “Be still &amp; know that I am God”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-339-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-339">339</a></span></span> is ever sounding, to silence human wishes or repinings. Our dear James said to me the other day so touchingly “Oh I am sorry the Emperor ever asked Father to come to Russia. but if I had Willie Wyatt &amp; Jacky<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-340-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-340">340</a></span></span> hereI should not feel so impatient Mother to get back to Stonington.” yet I cannot think it the climate here which affects his health, Willie never was as stout in his native land &amp; James looks better decidedly than when we brought him here. Our friend M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell is now well enough<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-341-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-341">341</a></span></span> to profit by the clean dry pavements, he usually invites Will to walk with him which is always a gratification to my little boy. James used to be his chosen companion in his rides, &amp; soon I hope he may join his kind friend in his strolls, he is in our parlor every evening now, being lonely in his own &amp; it not being thought prudent for him to venture out after dinner. At 8 oclock I am often still at my sewing or reading without a candle &amp; can hardly persuade James to put up his drawing to go to bed while it seems yet day light. Yesterday I took a stroll with Debo after dinner on the English Quai, she had promised to go to M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Ropes to tea &amp; when I looked at my watch &amp; told her it was seven oclock she thought it must be a mistake for the sun was shining on our faces. the ice of the Neva looks like plains of mud now, so much dirt has gone from the s<span class="CharOverride-9">ts</span> into it, every day we suppose it may break up, &amp; they prohibit any driving across, altho people still walk upon the Neva. We cannot drink the water now it looks so thick &amp; until we obtain a filterer, we melt ice from our ice house<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-342-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-342">342</a></span></span> for the table &amp; for our rooms. We hope the bridge may not be as long away this year as prophesied. (there is we hear a vast quantity of ice from the Lake Ladoga to pass down our river this season) Debo will feel her being prevented going over to the Island to the Maingays as much as I shall the interruption to my visits to my christian friend Miss Hirst.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-343-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-343">343</a></span></span> Willie &amp; I walked over the bridge Sunday afternoon as I had promised her I would go to read to her, this is the first call I have made here on the sabbath, tho so much visiting is in fashion in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg. as we passed by those selling fruit &amp;c at stalls &amp; could not avoid hearing every demonstration of forgetfulness of the divine command to “Remember the Lords day to keep it holy”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-344-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-344">344</a></span></span> my little boy made many remarks which I wished might have been in Russ to be understood by all who stared at the chatterbox. We saw two ladies in a coach in full dress going out to dinner I supposed, garlands of flowers on their heads &amp; large bouquets in their hands. then I thought “she who liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-345-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-345">345</a></span></span> I congratulated myself on at last seating myself by the bedside of the dear invalid, who always welcomes me with open arms. her nurse very soon prepared an orange for Willie’s refreshment after his walk of two miles, &amp; then he interested himself in a good little book which kept him quiet as a dozing kitten while I read aloud some of Miss Hirsts favorite chap from 2<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span> Corinthians, how forcible was every verse of the 4<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> &amp; 5<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>chap<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-346-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-346">346</a></span></span> while she commented so clearly upon them. I felt it was good to be with one so near heaven, &amp; always wish Debo would be introduced to this true friend, whose cheerfulness would render religion captivating to a young person — she has suffered exceedingly the last month, not able to read even her bible for three weeks, but now better. today I had a note from her own hand by her nurse &amp; in return for the books she brought my boys, sent back some nice calves foot jelly &amp; Ainsley Ginger cakes,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-347-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-347">347</a></span></span> knowing Miss Hirst relishes them</p>

Last evenings mail brought me a letter from my dear Sister Alicia with the joyful promise that she is coming to Russia with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Harrison. I hope soon to record good news from across the brook it is such a blank when a month intervenes between letters. Emma Maingay dined with us yesterday &amp; went with Debo to the Gellebrand tea party<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-349-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-349">349</a></span></span> at nine p.m M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell seemed as much to enjoy the duetts they played on piano &amp; harp while we were at our tea table as Whistler did. After they were obliged to leave us &amp; I had read to my boys as usual I found M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M alone in our parlor for Winans<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-350-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-350">350</a></span></span> was with Whis — in the Chancery, he cannot be absent from Alexandrofski<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-351-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-351">351</a></span></span> in the day &amp; comes almost every night on business of the shop — so we were tete a tete until past eleven. I arose this morning at five oclock to put a mustard plaister to my husbands throat. the temptation to take a nap after it was strong. but I resisted &amp; thus enjoyed reading my bible &amp; held communion with my God an hour before the rest of the family awoke. having no longer a little Charlie to awaken me early I have not risen till after the sun this spring, but I must recover my old habit of early rising again. Last week M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Maingay was so kind as to drive me about in her carriage two days, shewing me the way to different places where she has been well served for twelve years. when I can speak Russ as she does I may bargain as profitably. I was surprised in passing thro the Moskoy<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-352-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-352">352</a></span></span> to see at a shop window the beautiful scarlet plaid which M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ormerod<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-353-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-353">353</a></span></span> had given my boys for dresses, &amp; which I had given to the tailor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-354-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-354">354</a></span></span> (who made their g<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> coats — to make up into tunics a few days ago, I smiled &amp; said he was enticing customers, yet I did not suppose he would steal a vest pattern or two from the ample measures allowed to make the tunics full &amp; long enough to let out in case of their outgrowing. I shall never be sharp enough for the rogues I have to deal with here, so rare is honesty among the lower classes of this country that even Russians of the respectable sort acknowledge this is a nation of thieves. I paid the tailor 30 rubles banco for making the tunics, nor thought of examining them any further than that they fit nicely, the next day Mary detected how much they were stinted, the guilty rogue will not come, tho I have sent for him as if for further orders, he is self accused &amp; I do not envy him. I did not know till Emma M<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-355-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-355">355</a></span></span> told us of the young Grand Dukes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-356-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-356">356</a></span></span> wearing scarlet shirts that it was the favorite color for any but footmen of the Court, she admires Jemmie &amp; Willie exceedingly in their scarlet tunics, which indeed are so becoming I wish dear Annie O<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-357-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-357">357</a></span></span> could see how fine her taste proves to be. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Maingay &amp; Emma called this morning as they did not expect to come again for a week at least, &amp; we agreed it would be running to great a risk in us to fulfil our promise of spending tomorrow evening at their house, we might be obliged to spend a week, for there is every prognostic that the ice will move &amp; the bridge taken to one side to give it free passage without a half hours warning. Debo however would enjoy an embargo with her friends &amp; I promised if there was no disturbance on the Neva she should cross to the island bag &amp; baggage tomorrow morning to stay some days. My dear Whistler was much disturbed today by a communication from a young friend.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-358-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-358">358</a></span></span> time may disclose it, he retired to his room &amp; I observed frequently traces of emotion all day. he could scarcely sleep tho we did not retire till midnight, for this something on his mind.</p>

I have never heard a high wind in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg, in the evening however there was a threatening moaning sound as of an approaching storm &amp; we were sure the ice would go before morning. the wind was south east, Debo fancied she heard a cannon at midnight, which is the warning given when the Neva is rising an [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] an inundation may be expected. we could not remember what was the 3<span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>agent which combined with the breaking up of the ice &amp; the wind at south-east would prove fatal to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-360-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-360">360</a></span></span> but Debo was so uneasy Alexander was despatched to ask the Bushnics<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-361-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-361">361</a></span></span> opinion of the state of the river &amp; his report lulled her fears, tho her head continued to ache.</p>

I understood too late! the ships decorated &amp; hung with col<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> lamps on the river fronting the winter Palace looked very gala-like. This afternoon we dined at two &amp; drove to our country retreat to explore it once more previous to our taking possession. I was sorry Debo was not along to choose her rooms M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes went in her place, the drive was rather warm &amp; very dusty, our dear boys enjoyed their range exceedingly, &amp; I liked the house even better than before, our landlord had bought <span class="CharOverride-1">new</span> furniture for our accommodation, which with newly painted floors &amp;c promise us freedom from insects. The boys like the pond at the back door better than I do!</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday [May] 6<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Yesterday the river was full of floating ice, yet it felt like June weather, on our way to afternoon service however I observed the bridge in its place &amp; no ice. I rather hoped the Maingays would bring Debo to church. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Law gave us a beautiful discourse upon the <span class="CharOverride-1">Jealousy of God</span>, but few were present to profit by it. Lady Stuart<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-390-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-390">390</a></span></span> was one of the congregation, much improved by a half mourning dress, so much more suitable than bird of Paradise plume to one of her age &amp; ugliness. On our return from church Whistler took a row across the Neva to see Debo. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Maxwell joined us at tea &amp; we spent the evening quietly in serious conversation.

After lunching at the Cols we all walked to the Catherine Palace<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-398-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-398">398</a></span></span> situated in beautiful grounds kept in the most exquisite order. we observed many peasant women sweeping the grass plaits &amp; smoothing the gravel walks, gathering every speck from either into their aprons.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-399-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-399">399</a></span></span> water in lakes &amp; falls gives variety to the straight walks &amp; avenues, but the trees are not noble<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-400-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-400">400</a></span></span> tho the evergreens are fine. The Palace is at present the quarters of the <span class="CharOverride-1">heir</span> Grand Duke Alexander<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-401-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-401">401</a></span></span> when at Sarsco, for a New Palace<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-402-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-402">402</a></span></span> is occupied by the Emperor in another part of the town. This built by Catherine like all other of her designs is tasteful, costly &amp; still in perfect repair.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-403-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-403">403</a></span></span> we did not go into the chapel<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-404-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-404">404</a></span></span> at one end of it, as we had scarcely time to linger as long as we wished in the splendid suits [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] of apartments,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-405-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-405">405</a></span></span> which as we walked thro admiring the views of the grounds from the windows, seemed to exceed each in magnificence. &amp; again I was astonished at the perfect neatness &amp; freshness of a palace which has been built so many years. One suite of apartments in the Chinese style, furniture &amp; all to correspond, the walls, ceilings, doors &amp;c pannels of looking glass framed together by the finest chinese porcelain.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-406-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-406">406</a></span></span> Another suite of rooms with inlaid floors of Mother of pearl in flowers,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-407-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-407">407</a></span></span> as polished as a mirror, of course the <span class="CharOverride-1">path</span> thro out the palace is upon cloth to preserve the polished floors as no carpets are used. &amp; so much respect is required to be shewn to the place that servants are stationed to relieve gentlemen of their surtouts<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-408-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-408">408</a></span></span> on entering the Palace. I was troubled that M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell should be exposed to the risk of taking cold. for we all felt the chilling difference between the atmosphere of the galleries &amp; that of the warm sunshine the suite of apartments which had been furnished for the Grand Duchess Alexandrine on her marriage the past winter Debo thought most attractive for altho perfectly elegant they have a modern air of refinement not unsuitable to the taste &amp; convenience of the present day.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-409-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-409">409</a></span></span> but I was most interested by the room which the Emperor Alexander had occupied just before his death.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-410-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-410">410</a></span></span> the camp bed behind the screen &amp; simplicity of all its furniture shewed he wished only conveniences for himself, where splendor reigned. they pretend<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-411-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-411">411</a></span></span> that no article has been changed since he was there, fine damask napkins as if just used the day before are hung over the chair &amp; all the paraphanalia of his toilette razors, brushes &amp;c upon his dressing table. Debo was the only one who yeilded to expressions of delight, my boys seem not yet to have their heart in these things &amp; I could add a wish that they never might — Jemmie wished he could stay to examine the fine pictures &amp; know who painted them,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-412-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-412">412</a></span></span> but as we returned thro the grounds &amp; I asked him if he should wish to be a grand duke to have them for play grounds, he decided there could be no freedom with a footman at ones heels! On our going back to the Cols a nice dinner was soon placed on the table, for dessert among the various temptations forms of cream, which were no doubt all the better for coming from the dairy of the Catherine Palace, as the Grand Duke A has fine cattle on his farm<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-413-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-413">413</a></span></span> — I had forgotten to mention the extensive Conservatories<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-414-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-414">414</a></span></span> attached to his grounds we had not time to enter them, they looked tempting so many exotics peeping thro the open glass, for the day was bright &amp; warm as June. We returned to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg by the 5 oclock train, &amp; from the mirth of the young folks I judged they were not wearied by the rational pleasure we had been occupied with all day. Willie &amp; James were bountiful with their riddles for M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M &amp; Sister to solve &amp; laughter was infectious. Being engaged to tea at M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Maingays we had only time to dress when our neighbours the Ropes were ready for we had agreed to cross together in the same barge. the only stranger to me was a Miss Musgrove, who is English governess in some Russian family of distinction,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-415-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-415">415</a></span></span> a very superior lady, I enjoyed conversing with herself &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> M while the girls &amp; Ropes played at cross purposes.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-416-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-416">416</a></span></span> At eleven oclock we went home in our barge for we felt no fear tho there was no moon, it was not dark.

Our friends find the roads so good &amp; the distance so easy we are not deserted. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell has been twice to see us<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-420-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-420">420</a></span></span> &amp; promises to stay some days, the Maingays several times &amp; Emma spent a week,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-421-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-421">421</a></span></span> &amp; tho it was for the delight of Debos society she sometimes sat in my room to read aloud in such books as comfort the christian. she is a very gifted girl, but to my ear her voice in reading is sweeter than at the piano &amp; I shall have a pleasing association of her always for she was ever ready to gratify me by reading or serious conversation while I sat at work — How secure it is to love those who love the Saviour. I pray this young friend of my dear daughter may retain the same views in London she has been brought up with, that she may become the decided young Christian her Sister Eliza is<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-422-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-422">422</a></span></span> — Of course it is painful to part from those who have made <span class="CharOverride-1">friends</span> of us when strangers in a foreign land, but the Maingays have paid their last visit to us &amp; we to them ere they returned to their native land. I have been busy today writing by them to my friends &amp; sisters in Lancashire. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Stockhol<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-423-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-423">423</a></span></span> has just arrived I must go out to do the honors, it is very friendly of him to come in a hard rain to see us. I cannot think as I did last month it never rains in Russia we have had complete April weather this week. the verdure around us is refreshing &amp; the sun set thro the wood opposite our house we never tire of admiring, I always think of my dear Mother &amp; wish her here. Our grounds are kept in the most perfect order without trouble to us &amp; last Sat our landlord sent us in from his green house more than a dozen plants in full flower, Hydrangias, Roses, &amp; Stocks every window sill is filled.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-424-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-424">424</a></span></span> The quiet of the country accords with my wishes &amp; altho it is the common practise to entertain guests on Sunday especially during the Summer which is the busy season among merchants, it is understood that I am averse to it, therefore our acquaintances favor us other days. Last Sunday we had our new Curate.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-425-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-425">425</a></span></span> I liked his fervent manner he seemed not to think he was in a strange congregation, both himself &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Law officiated at the communion service.

I understand it is rejoiced in by them as the first day of summer, so tho the weather was less Summer like than any we have had for a month we saw many dressed in book muslins &amp; gauzes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-430-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-430">430</a></span></span> going to church of the better classes, &amp; the lower order of women had managed to put on white gowns, yet still the <span class="CharOverride-1">very poor</span> in their sheep skins crossing themselves before the Picture of the Virgin at the door. In the afternoon we saw bands of Peasants sauntering along the road, for their choruses attracted us to the window, but tho Emma professed to delight in their music I found even she could not persuade herself they sung <span class="CharOverride-1">hymns</span>. Oh no their words she said were foolish &amp; low beyond our conception. Ah if I could speak to them I would teach them how they should spend the Lords day! for tho they are all eager for Tracts,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-431-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-431">431</a></span></span> the mass seem to reflect no more than the dumb beast which perish<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-432-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-432">432</a></span></span></p>

I feel as my friend Miss Hirst I’d give all but my own salvation, to convert them to Christ. plenty are ever to be seen crossing themselves before the shocking pictures of the Virgin in whatever direction we may go. but they turn from that to <span class="CharOverride-1">do evil</span> &amp; confess if questioned they do it as a form &amp; not with any reverence.

Debo practised while her father read American papers to me while I sewed, after my boys had taken their bread &amp; milk &amp; gone to bed I went up to their room &amp; read in one of the good books Miss Hirst supplies them with. we took our coffee after nine &amp; had not to light a candle until to read the bible &amp; prayers &amp; for bed.</p>

I was not so well pleased with it as I had expected, too much space seems to have been given to Show, in the grand staircase &amp; five rooms designed for entertainment,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-453-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-453">453</a></span></span> we recrossed the Neva in a boat &amp; were dissappointed M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell was not ready to drive home with us as we had planned to a 4 clock dinner, he followed us however before sunset &amp; we hope he will enjoy his visit to our Dom on Drurys estate.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-454-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-454">454</a></span></span> We had a delightful saunter thro some of our neighbours grounds,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-455-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-455">455</a></span></span> a winding avenue of birch enclosing sometimes a meadow carpetted with wild flowers, or a pond of water with pretty boats upon it gave sufficient variety to call forth our admiration &amp; on our way back the setting sun gilded the woods, &amp; my heart was warmed with adoration &amp; thankfulness that God so bountifully provided enjoyments for us. it was late for my boys, &amp; I could not read to them as usual when they went to bed, but we made no stranger of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell &amp; were glad to close our evening with family worship<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-456-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-456">456</a></span></span> &amp; wish each other good night. This morning before we were out of our room, our dear Willies voice was heard welcoming our friend M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes who had come 10 versts to breakfast with us. he soon joined Will &amp; Debo at the swing. I let them enjoy it awhile as I stood talking with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell on the front piazza then rung the prayer bell which soon assembled us all in the parlor. Our cook had excellent hot rolls, minced meat, fresh eggs &amp; coffee on our table by eight oclock, we were all blessed with health, to appreciate her skill appetites were ready &amp; we had a jovial meal. when M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> R was about to mount his tall steed to return to his mercantile pursuits, I filled his side pocket with American apples for his Ellen<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-457-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-457">457</a></span></span> as she could not eat them here today. While writing just now Whistler who has staid at home today called me to the Piazza to see the troops passing from S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg to Peterhoff. they proved to be the Chevalier Guards. mounted on fine black horses, all their officers are young noblemen I was pleased to discover M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M &amp; our boys in the wood opposite also enjoying the sight of this noble cavalry. James has brought in a string of Perch which he caught &amp; now both he &amp; Willie are ready to read to me I must attend to instructing them till dinner time as their father proposes us a drive after, the weather is so very favorable &amp; the late rains have laid the dust for which this road is notorious,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-458-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-458">458</a></span></span> mosquitoes annoying!</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday 10<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> June. Before noting down how profitably we have spent this day, quietly at home, I must touch upon the pleasant drive hinted at above. it was along the Peterhoff road but further than we had been, as we usually make our excursions on foot Whistler having the horses in town, we drove past some beautiful Seats occupied by Russian or English gentry.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-459-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-459">459</a></span></span> Debo pointed out the Estate where the pretty M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Anderson<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-460-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-460">460</a></span></span> as she is called spends her Summers she is near enough to be a neighbour to us &amp; as she sings delightfully Debo wishes to have her among our few visitors, further on she pointed to an estate that our friends the Maingays occupied,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-461-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-461">461</a></span></span> but it is not so conveniently near town as we must live so we cannot promise Jemmie to try to rent it next year! We passed a fine Monastery<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-462-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-462">462</a></span></span> which my curiosity would have led me inside of for we saw there was an evening service performing. the last place we drove to was the finest the name on the gate which is always attached to the Dacha (or country house) told us a very rich Russian Nobleman was the possessor of the pretty Italian-looking villa M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell said Count—— was master of horse to the Grand Duchess Helen.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-463-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-463">463</a></span></span> Our friend on retiring to his room for rest confessed how much he had enjoyed his day with us. The next morning when we assembled at prayers Mary had a sad report from Miss Debo the mosquitos had feasted on her face during her last nights slumbers, &amp; it proved that she must be a prisoner in her room all day. I never saw such swellings occasioned by these little insects before, altho James has been poisoned here by them also in an extraordinary degree. her forehead was in two puffs &amp; her eyes half closed, she used iced water &amp; vinegar all day, yet still the next morning her phiz was as unnatural as ever.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-464-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-464">464</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Maxwell interests himself so much in the boys &amp; Whistler being in the house time was not idle with him, he was kind enough to sit by me some part of the morning read to me a letter from his own dear mother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-465-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-465">465</a></span></span> written just previous to her having heard of his late illness, she expresses her regard for me in the most gratifying terms, that she loves me as a sister &amp; hopes she yet shall claim my friendship in my own native land.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-466-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-466">466</a></span></span> I felt overpowered that her sons mention of our family in his correspondence should have elicited such an interested [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] in unworthy me! M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M also favored me by handing me a letter he had lately received from a Norwegian<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-467-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-467">467</a></span></span> he have [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] spent some hours last Summer with this gentleman in Christiana, a correspondence had ensued, &amp; the Norwegian wrote in as glowing terms of the United States as of his own republic, the hand was like copperplate &amp; the English correct. I was not aware before how happily Norway is governed, titles have been abolished there seem to be no poor there, the religion is Lutheran &amp; all who hold any office in that country must be members of the Christian church,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-468-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-468">468</a></span></span> it is a cheap country for there are no duties &amp; the most salubrious climate in northern Europe. What a pity that intoxication should be the besetting sin of the lower orders – but as wine &amp; liquors are without duty they are sadly too cheap. I fear tho M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M met not one beggar in Norway,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-469-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-469">469</a></span></span> drunkeness will make many. God forbid! rather may a better spirit influence to forsake what will destroy the good effect of all the advantages they have within their reach. We had quite a trading at our front gate with a Russian Pedlar while M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M was with us. little Willie &amp; James talked him into some bargains M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M sent their sister up a jumping rope a basket also for her work _ thus recommending industry &amp; exercise. I was glad Debo was able to present herself friday evening<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-470-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-470">470</a></span></span> as it was the last of his stay. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Miller<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-471-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-471">471</a></span></span> &amp; Curtis<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-472-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-472">472</a></span></span> arrived to tea, the former was once President of the Bank of England.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-473-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-473">473</a></span></span> his hair is white as snow now &amp; he talks of his wife &amp; daughters in England,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-474-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-474">474</a></span></span> still he is most cheerful &amp; so great an amateur of music he is willing to ride this far at any time to listen to Debos piano or harp — After they left at eleven oclock we rung for lights because we must have our outside shutters closed to secure us from thieves. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M has been much amused with the tattooing the watchmen keep up at intervals thro the night to shew to the families they are on guard.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-475-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-475">475</a></span></span> it is a shameful evidence of the defects of the religious system, but I trust when the gospel is preached freely to all nations this people so very apt to learn as they seem, may be honest thro love to God &amp; not from fear of man. I felt very sorry M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M found it necessary to leave us on saturday morning<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-476-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-476">476</a></span></span> to prepare for going in the next Steamer to Stettin,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-477-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-477">477</a></span></span> he accompanied Whistler in his Droshky to town promising to come out again for 24 hours at least.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-478-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-478">478</a></span></span> The Ropes drove out to see us about our dinner time, it is such a proof of their regard for us I feel as tho I could hardly be kind enough in my welcome of children nurses &amp; all. We ladies &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> R took a stroll about a verst on the public road &amp; turned into the beautiful grounds belonging to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> — Dacha<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-479-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-479">479</a></span></span> &amp; brought away each a large bunch of every variety of pretty wild flowers, lilies of the valley among the rest. the circular avenue of birch encloses a rich praierie on a small scale the wild flowers make such a carpet. When we were taking an early tea my dear Whistler came back from the city &amp; right glad was I we had a comfortable meal all ready to refresh him after his days fatigue. I could not be amused<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-480-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-480">480</a></span></span> at hearing Jemmies remark after the Ropes had gone, he wished M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> R or M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M might be with us all the time, one so merry the other so agreable! he really felt sad to let them leave our house. My boys had their bath as usual Saturday &amp; they needed it uncommonly after their romps with some Cadets who had come up from school to pass the Sabbath with M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Norman<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-481-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-481">481</a></span></span> their grandmother who lives on the same estate with us. Sunday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-482-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-482">482</a></span></span> was so cold I was not too warm with my English woolen cloak over my velvet mantilla<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-483-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-483">483</a></span></span> &amp; poplin gown<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-484-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-484">484</a></span></span> in riding to church. I regretted so few were there to listen to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams excellent sermon from S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Luke 16<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> and 31<span class="CharOverride-9">st</span> verse.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-485-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-485">485</a></span></span> he preaches the word indeed with power. Oh my heart glowed with thankfulness to God that such a teacher of righteousness had come to supply our Pastors place. Whistler alluded to his sermon as he rode home &amp; said he gave no quarter, Debo thought him bigotted altho she confessed she listened to his earnest pleading with pleasure. I gave it as my conviction M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams would hold out the hand of fellowship to any thorough Christian whether Presbyterian or Episcopalian, but I thought he must condemn any who were lukewarm followers of Him who had Himself despised all such. And my dear husband agreed with me that M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W brought every one to the Bible to try of what spirit they were. It always pains me to observe our road so full of people of all ranks intent on idleness or pleasure (falsely called) &amp; I am so sorry so many English families when they move into the country for the Summer reconcile it to their consciences never to go to town to attend divine service, eleven oclock allows ample time, &amp; if the drive took two hours instead of one I’d consider it a privilige to be able to accomplish it. I find after we dine there is not too much leisure to occupy with my boys in reading. they enjoy it for Miss Hirsts<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-486-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-486">486</a></span></span> supply of religious books yeilds us great variety, so that we never need a walk to add to it. Whistler kept beside us listening with pleased satisfaction to a story illustrating the 4<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Commandment,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-487-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-487">487</a></span></span> the contrast between mis-spending and spending-well the last day (in preparation of the first day of the week, &amp; of those who loved to keep the <span class="CharOverride-1">sign</span> that they were Gods people, my boys had many remarks to make, and that we may always experience the blessedness of the day of rest we here enjoy I earnestly pray. the little Normans<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-488-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-488">488</a></span></span> come in to listen to my Sunday afternoon readings, &amp; as Jemmie and Willie take coffee with us they have many pleasures which those who live in the gay world could scarcely appreciate. After my boys had gone to bed &amp; I had read to them a chapter I seated myself between Debo &amp; her father by the parlor window admiring the effect of the setting sun upon the wood opposite our house. When it was ten oclock having selected two beautiful chapters for our evening service I thought as we were without guests we would by day light join in family worship. I <span class="CharOverride-1">felt</span> much as I read the 42<span class="CharOverride-9">nd</span> Psalm, &amp; the comforting words of the 40<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>of Isaiah<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-489-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-489">489</a></span></span> &amp; was so absorbed in our Sabbath evening prayer in the conclusion that I heard not the approaching footsteps of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Miller,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-490-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-490">490</a></span></span> tho Whistler did, he softly withdrew until our family service was over, then came in saying on his way from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> F Bairds<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-491-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-491">491</a></span></span> where he had been dining he promised M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> Curtis to call &amp; ask us to fix a day for the excursion to Lake Ladoga.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-492-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-492">492</a></span></span> he sat half an hour with us &amp; took the trouble to recount to me how he had spent his sabbath, at church in the morning by the sick couch of a friend afterwards until five o clock when he felt it no harm to take a solitary ride to dine with friends in the country. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Miller &amp; I always have a pleasant argument upon religion, he is very good tempered &amp; altho he says I am too strict, he has too much good feeling to infringe upon my priviliges as a Christian &amp; manages his visits to us on week days that he may not intrude upon our Sabbaths.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday 17<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>June Any Indifferent person might judge we had leisure for journalizing or even idling hours of these long days in the retirement of Peterhoff road, but when the time of retiring to my chamber comes to review the day I invariably confess to how <span class="CharOverride-1">much</span> I have left undone that ought to have been done, for between housekeeping, teaching my dear boys, studying a little french &amp; Russ myself, a visit to our neighbours &amp; receiving a visiter now &amp; then from town I accomplish nothing with my pen, except in the way of hurried scrawls to England &amp; to my dear native land. Last week we had a farewell visit of 24 hours from our favorite M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-493-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-493">493</a></span></span> the same day W<span class="CharOverride-9U">m</span> Maingay<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-494-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-494">494</a></span></span> came unexpectedly, ensuring his welcome by bringing a letter from Emma dated Lubec giving Dasha a most entertaining sheet full of their voyage from S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-495-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-495">495</a></span></span> We had a stroll between dinner &amp; tea thro an estate about half a verst from our domicile,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-496-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-496">496</a></span></span> where wild flowers abound. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M talked with me much about his fathers country seat upon our beautiful Hudson.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-497-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-497">497</a></span></span> my little Willie is his shadow when he can be &amp; as he used his Russian Jack knife to cut the stalks of flowers I gathered, he called to mind the bonnie wee pen knife mother had lost in her desk, whereupon our friend took his pen knife out of his pocket &amp; offered it to me for a kopeck that it might not cut him out of my memory. I the next morning gave him half a kopeeck<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-498-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-498">498</a></span></span> for it! and also a note of introduction to our kind fellow passengers<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-499-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-499">499</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Baird,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-500-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-500">500</a></span></span> who were to be his on board the same Steamer Alexandra! Ah how full my heart was as I recalled the scenes of my babys illness &amp; death in that cabin, where the sympathy of these ladies M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Baird &amp; her Sister Miss Khremer bound me to them. And now they have gone from S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg for 5 years<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-501-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-501">501</a></span></span> I can scarcely expect to meet them again in this life.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-502-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-502">502</a></span></span> May we in a better! Many might suppose the name of the Alexandra would call up painful emotions so that I should not bear to hear it mentioned, but it is not so, it is an indulgence to me to visit the cabin in imagination where I last held my Charlie to my bosom, last heard his soft voice say he loved his own Mother, &amp; say his evening prayer. even to go to the lonely State room <span class="CharOverride-1">A</span> where I gazed on his body in death is a selfish indulgence to me which I cannot always suppress &amp; I always feel the wish to be a passenger again on board the Alexandra that I may in reality occupy the same state room we were in together. But my chief desire is to keep ever in view that bright haven where we may meet at last to part no more, where we may “all be one in Christ Jesus our Lord!”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-503-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-503">503</a></span></span> Only this far have I attempted to write up my journal being left by Whistler &amp; Debo while they take a walk to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Anderson,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-504-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-504">504</a></span></span> when my dear little neighbour<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-505-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-505">505</a></span></span> comes in to sit with me. And another week has rolled over my head for this evening is Tues 25<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> June. Yesterday Debo received a letter by the last Steamer from her twin enclosing one from dear little Emma Palmer<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-506-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-506">506</a></span></span> to me. All well &amp; my dear Mother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-507-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-507">507</a></span></span> soon expected to be there.

Last Sunday we all went to Church, it was the day of Saint Barnabas the Apostle &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams text was “For he was a good man, full of faith &amp; of the Holy Ghost”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-510-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-510">510</a></span></span> from which he drew the character of a christian, comparing it with that of a worldly <span class="CharOverride-1">good</span> man, moral benevolent, &amp;c &amp;c, but remarked no code of morals could satisfy a true christian which was not based upon faith in Jesus Christ our Lord &amp; Saviour. The Sunday before I had been induced to give up the benefit of listening to him for the duty of spending the morning by the bed side of my suffering friend Miss Hirst,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-511-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-511">511</a></span></span> she was speechless &amp; it comforted her to hear me read the scriptures, she had greatly sunk within the week &amp; continued so feeble I have gone purposely to spend an hour with her several times since, she is fond of flowers, the doctor says he needs not ask who has been with her the fresh bouquet shews my visits, &amp; it is a privilige I may not long enjoy for she seems gradually sinking into the grave. I perceive from time to time she looks thinner &amp; paler if possible, so I go once or twice a week now the ll versts between us purposely to see her. no complaint arises from her increased sufferings, tho when I question her she tells me what by the Lords strengthening her she is enabled to endure, perhaps one hours sleep in a whole night &amp; such perspirations her clothing has all to be changed ten times in the 24 hours! sometimes when I have been gently fanning her, or bathing her hands in Cologne or putting a small lump of ice in her parched lips, she exerts herself to whisper “Inasmuch as ye do it unto one of the least of these my disciples, ye do it unto Me”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-512-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-512">512</a></span></span> Oh to me she seems a distinguished Saint! and I wonder that I am selected when there are so many others more worthy the privilige of becoming her friend, she always addresses me by the tender epithet of Love &amp; having lost her only Sister &amp; both her parents<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-513-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-513">513</a></span></span> if God permits I will close her eyes in death &amp; be as a Sister to her, she has an only &amp; kind brother in M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hirst,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-514-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-514">514</a></span></span> but his school demands most of his time, her attentive Nurse Elona<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-515-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-515">515</a></span></span> tho neat &amp; excellent in her capacity is a Russian, and lacks the attraction of the knowledge that is in Christ Jesus our Lord, when Miss Hirst has begged her not to sew on Sunday telling her it made her unhappy to witness the breaking of Gods command, she has answered the time would hang heavy without employment! my friend has said many times to me she would give all but her own soul to be able to talk Russ sufficiently well to teach the poor &amp; ignorant the gospel plan of Salvation.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-516-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-516">516</a></span></span></p>

We feel obliged now to use the horses &amp; about six oclock as the sun shone out bright we took a drive meeting M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Joseph Ropes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-533-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-533">533</a></span></span> at our gate we took him in by way of benefitting by his call, &amp; he directed our “Coacher” a pretty circuit from the Crasnacello road<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-534-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-534">534</a></span></span> back to this, by which we passed the most beautiful seat I have yet seen in Russia It used to belong to Booterlin<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-535-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-535">535</a></span></span> &amp; report says he lost it by a throw of the dice! when Jemmie heard it is now in the possession of Count Straugnoff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-536-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-536">536</a></span></span> he was scarcely to be restrained from calling, forgetting he only knew the young Count &amp; merely as a fellow passenger on board the Alexandra! there is a lake on the estate encircled by a walk in the nicest order &amp; besides boat house, trees &amp;c to render it picturesque a mill seat below. We had the finest view of the Gulf of Finland from the vicinity of this mansion &amp; also of S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg, the gilded dome of the Isaacs Church,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-537-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-537">537</a></span></span> &amp; the Spire of the Fortress<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-538-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-538">538</a></span></span> glittering in the distance.

Saturday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-541-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-541">541</a></span></span> morning was bright &amp; we had no dread of being overtaken by a shower when we set out for town to shop &amp; make calls. Debo went to M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʀ</span> Laws thro the court at the back of the church as we drove thro the Galernia when I had to stop at our Grocers.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-542-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-542">542</a></span></span> with the help of little Willies fluency in Russ I obtained all I wished, then drove to the Island. while I called upon M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hirst<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-543-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-543">543</a></span></span> I sent my dear boy in to Miss Hirsts<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-544-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-544">544</a></span></span> apartment with a fresh bouquet for her &amp; Fedor carried some jelly to the Nurse, also for this interesting invalid. when I entered her room Willie was arranging the roses in some vases beside her bed, she looked brighter than for many weeks past &amp; conversed with ease, but soon requested me as usual to read some of Gods word for her support, as now she is dependent on others for this comfort. her sight is enfeebled &amp; her hands more powerless than ever. I alighted at the Parsonage for Debo (after Willie &amp; I had done our shopping in the Nevski, what should I do without this darling child, he is rather less excitable than Jemmie &amp; therefore more tractable, they each can make their wants comprehended in Russ but I prefer this gentlest of my dear boys to go with me. having suited myself with Summer caps &amp; gloves for them both my business was over, except to apologise for Whistlers not having called yet upon M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-545-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-545">545</a></span></span> the season for work in the field is so short<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-546-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-546">546</a></span></span> &amp; his undertaking so vast, he has no leisure for pleasure. We had hardly regained our “Dacha”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-547-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-547">547</a></span></span> or country house before the heavy clouds which had so suddenly gathered discharged thunder, &amp; a tremendous rain. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> J Ropes was caught in the wood opposite our house &amp; while he left his cousin M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hooper<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-548-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-548">548</a></span></span> (just from Boston) under the trees he ran over to borrow an umbrella. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Prince<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-549-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-549">549</a></span></span> &amp; young Merrilies<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-550-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-550">550</a></span></span> also sought shelter under our roof, they had been with our Jemmie in a boat on the Canal at the end of our Avenue. When M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-551-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-551">551</a></span></span> came to see us after the weather cleared he described how droll they all looked in borrowed coats after their soaking! Just as we were seating us at tea, a carriage drew up to our door &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Miller entered introducing Sir W<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ɵ</span> Allen<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-552-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-552">552</a></span></span> the great Scotch artist of whom we have lately heard who has come to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg to revive on canvass some of the most striking events from the life of Peter the G<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʈ</span>. They had been to the Monastery on the this [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] road of Seergay<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-553-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-553">553</a></span></span> to listen to the chaunting at vespers in the Greek chapel. &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M laughingly congratulated his companion that they were just in the nick of time for our excellent home made bread &amp; fresh butter, &amp; above all the refreshment of a good cup of tea! When he offered the cake basket afterwards to Sir William he recommended the plum cake as being made at home &amp; so like Scotch bun!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-554-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-554">554</a></span></span> adding M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> W has visited Edenburg<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-555-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-555">555</a></span></span> &amp; is partial to the Scotch! A slight interruption to his satisfaction was when a note from M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes caused Debo to leave the table, he protested against it saying “Miss W you should make them understand you attend to no business after dinner” his chat then turned upon the subject of Sir W Allens painting (Peter the G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> teaching the Moozeecks<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-556-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-556">556</a></span></span> to make ships)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-557-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-557">557</a></span></span> this made Jemmies eyes express so much interest, that his love for the art was discovered &amp; Sir W<span class="CharOverride-9">m</span> must see his attempts. When my boys had said good night the artist remarked to me “your little boy has uncommon genious, but do not urge him beyond his inclination” I told him it had only been cultivated as an amusement &amp; that I was obliged to interfere or his application would confine him more than we approved.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-558-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-558">558</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Miller took a chance while Debo was playing for his countryman to say to me. “Do you know why I have come today? it is that I may not offend you by intruding on Sunday, sometimes I have such a desire to see you all so very much I cannot overcome it even on Sunday” I told him he must be sure I should welcome my husbands friends every day but upon the Sabbath when I considered myself engaged. he laughed &amp; said “what is to become of poor Batchelors then? but I respect your views madam for in Scotland we are brought up to be very strict about the observance of the Sabbath, but the major is not so particular as you are, perhaps sometimes when he is at home you will excuse my coming from town to walk with him? I now laughed &amp; answered tho I knew my husband would scold me for such inhospitable treatment of his friends, yet I must confess I missed him from my Sunday readings with our children &amp; I really thought as the Merchants have no Change to go to on Saturday afternoon they must have set it apart as a holiday instead of being obliged <span class="CharOverride-1">for their health</span> to steal half of the Lords day which I always found too short for reading the many good books, I am always <span class="CharOverride-1">intending</span> to profit by. He always is so good tempered &amp; so frank I can venture to tell him plainly what I think without fear of offending. He tried to extort a promise from me that I would consent to his driving Miss W &amp; myself in his Phaeton<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-559-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-559">559</a></span></span> soon. but I told him we were <span class="CharOverride-1">obliged</span> to use the Majors horses every day to keep them in order against his return,” for I well know how the busy bodies would talk if we should be met on this road where so many English are, &amp; we have always endeavoured to go on our path of duty without notoriety. but I have been entering too minutely into our coversation [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>]. Altho we have had rain every day this month, it has not been ever until after our return from church on Sundays. the congregation was twice as full the last Sabbath as usual. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams text was from the 15<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of Rom 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>verse.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-560-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-560">560</a></span></span> he first alluded to the text he had preached from the sunday (I spent with Miss Hirst) “If I please men I am not the servant of Christ”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-561-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-561">561</a></span></span> &amp; while he remarked upon the seeming contradictions of different parts of the bible, reconciled them by saying like its divine author it was full of mysteries, that hereafter these should be cleared away &amp; we must read with prayer &amp; meditation that our faith might be strengthened, but that the context of his present subject shewed how we should please our neighbour &amp; to his <span class="CharOverride-1">edification</span>, that we should put no stumbling block in his way. but strive all to be one in Christ Jesus” After church when M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Curtis handed us to the Calash<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-562-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-562">562</a></span></span> he asked if we would go to see the launch of a frigate<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-563-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-563">563</a></span></span> on thursday, but really I felt sorry that worldly engagements should present themselves &amp; thanking him said I could not so suddenly make up my mind, so he walked out on monday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-564-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-564">564</a></span></span> to take tea with us, however we concluded as Whistler was absent we had better not venture into the crowd which of course would fill the Admiralty square for the spectacle.

How pained the fond Empress mother who watches beside the sick couch or that lovely daughter must be by such want of sympathy. Report says the Grand Duchess Olgar is indignant at the unfeeling conduct of her new brother in law, &amp; says while she weeps at the prospect of being deprived of her adored Sister, it is well she will be summoned to a happier world ere she could be aware of the heartlessness of the Prince.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-566-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-566">566</a></span></span> How little we think in passing thro magnificent Palaces of the aching hearts at times there! I remember as Debo observed the perfection of taste displayed in that suite of apartments which had been newly furnished in the Catherine Palace for this young couple, I thought they at least might be exempt from all intrustion [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] of evil upon their happiness in each other, both so young, so accomplished, so admired &amp; she I knew deservedly beloved by all classes! but <span class="CharOverride-1">vanity</span> is stamped on all perishable things!

Whistler says he must not indulge himself by staying so much at home again, as he suffers from home sickness dreadfully. but I should think the remedy painful as the effect.

M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gillebrand gave me the content of a letter he had received from the interior of Russia because it said I must be interested in the good cause. it was from an old German Baron<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-574-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-574">574</a></span></span> had been translated into excellent english, the strain was one of deep piety, devotion to the spread of the gospel. he described the blessed effects of the distribution of Tracts, the only channel now left in this land, for bibles are no longer allowed to be printed<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-575-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-575">575</a></span></span> &amp; it is also forbidden that any should speak of any other faith than the Greek faith to the poor, who nevertheless seldom hear a sermon in their own churches, &amp; the service being in a language they do not understand, the Slavonian, they quiet their consciences by bowing &amp; crossing themselves before pictures of the virgin &amp; child, unless when awakened by truths from the tracts, which they are so eager to obtain they will walks versts for them. the old Baron writes for thousands more <span class="CharOverride-1">for all classes</span>, soldiers in particular. Landlords are glad to have them distributed among their serfs &amp; tenantry. for the [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] benefit by the change in their habits &amp; lives from the good effects. I was indeed delighted to learn all this &amp; as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> G promised Debo the original document for a german exercise, I shall hope to send her translation to my native land. Our boys have great pleasure in distributing Tracts, on Sunday especially when we observe a knot of idle young men playing, or lolling on the grass, we pitch out a Tract which they pick up as a prize, &amp; thank us as if from their hearts, but the most satisfactory way of distributing them is when regiments are passing to give one to each soldier - asking permission first from the commanding officer, which they are too polite to refuse - this week thousands have in this way been distributed by dear M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gillebrand, for our road has been thronged by troops. she says they always halt at her gate, as for three years she has done thus. but yesterday she was made rather uneasy by the report Alexa<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-576-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-576">576</a></span></span> carried her of the displeasure of the officers, when the soldiers broke their ranks &amp; shoved each other in the ditch, in their haste to receive the tracts for them, she so dreads a prohibition! but the word is now abroad in this land! May it produce fruit!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-577-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-577">577</a></span></span> Yesterday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-578-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-578">578</a></span></span> while we were reading Mexico, the boys out playing with their Russian playmates in this enclosure — M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes drove up bringing a letter to Debo it was from Emma Maingay, dated Black heath<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-579-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-579">579</a></span></span> near London — After our tea we ordered the Droshky that Debo might call upon Miss Law<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-580-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-580">580</a></span></span> at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Andersons, we were invited to take seats on the back Piazza, I found myself at the side of a kind of Miss Becky Dugude<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-581-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-581">581</a></span></span> a poor cousin of the family I understand &amp; liked her much, she seems to have a heart overflowing with kindness, &amp; loves little children. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Anderson (called the beautiful M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> A) came down all ready for a ride on horse back, we persuaded her not to let our call hinder her as it was already past eight oclock – as she mounted &amp; kissed her fair hand in adieu, leaving an invitation with her husband for us to take tea the next day, which I declined. Debo enjoyed herself with the two young ladies left to entertain her in a Russian “Gee joggle” formed by a plank laid across a low block of wood. they stood up one at each end &amp; kept time with each other jumping, a gentleman on the ground by each, to hold the lady by the hand. the Peasant girls need no one to keep them at the end of the board for they are expert in this exercise,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-582-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-582">582</a></span></span> but it would be dangerous if one jumped too far back, as a fall backwards would be rather awkward. the effect of the game is so pretty I told Debo, on our drive home, she must describe it to Jule that it might be adopted at Stonington.This morning Jemmie began relating anecdotes from the life of Charles the 12<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>of Sweden &amp; rather to upbraid me that I would not <span class="CharOverride-1">let</span> him do as that monarch had done at 7 years old, manage a horse! I discovered he had taken the volume to bed<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-583-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-583">583</a></span></span> &amp; read whileI thought him asleep. the truth is my Jemmie has fallen into those habits of late rising in consequence of keeping awake till ten oclock that I have removed him from the nursery to my room, that in his fathers absence I may manage him, I should have been at a loss how to afford my dear boys a military parade today but there was an encampment of cadets about two estates off &amp; they went with Col Drurys<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-584-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-584">584</a></span></span> sons to see them, they have several play fellows now Scharchinka (or little Alexander), Vaascha (or little William) are their favorites.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-585-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-585">585</a></span></span> The flies are most tormenting! they really crawl into my eyes, there is no frightening them off by brushing. When our queer Virginia Randolph was Ambassador to this country he only staid a few days &amp; complained he found “all the plagues of Egypt here with none of its fertility!”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-586-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-586">586</a></span></span> but the country looks luxuriant now. It is hay-making time, I fear many of the beautiful fields of wild flowers have been sacrificed by the scythe. I have enjoyed so much pleasure in selecting from the many varieties in my walks with Willie to decorate my parlor, the delicate blue forgetmenot is very abundant on the marshy land here &amp; keeps quite fresh a week in water. I every day wish for my dear Mother to delight in rambling thro the flowery meads with us! she would be stopped at every step to pick something new as I am. Willie has been seeking strawberries in the wood but none scarcely are ripe yet! we have had too much rain &amp; too little heat.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Friday 5<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> July. Major &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Trouvellier<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-587-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-587">587</a></span></span> drove up from the city to spend the evening with us, we had not long returned from a drive of about 12 versts, having attended the vespers at Seergay Monastery. where the chaunting is delightful. we saw many poor &amp; rich assembled at prayers, all alike at time [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] touching their foreheads upon the pavement crossing themselves incessantly. I watched one lady with the deepest interest she was dressed in white muslin, put me rather in mind of M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Barns<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-588-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-588">588</a></span></span> &amp; seemed truly absorbed in her silent devotions, using fewer gestures than the others &amp; kneeling longer, her fair brow occasionally pressed against the hard cold pavement. We could understand when the priests offered the prayer for the Imperial family by the names, &amp; we imagined when all there joined most vociferously it was for the favorite Grand Duchess Alexandrine. The little Chapel is richly gilded, the screen before the Holy of Holies — into which the foot of none but the Priests may never [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] enter — filled with pictures of the Saviour, Saints &amp; Virgin Mary. Shrines on every side with pictures of Saints &amp; tapers burning before them. I observed where we first went in a priest at a table teeming with kopeecks already — selling these tapers to the people to burn before their patron Saints. Three times during the service the gilded doors of the screen were unfolded &amp; a beautiful Altar peice discovered, a painting of the Trinity. Our blessed Saviour bearing his cross but seated in Heaven beside the Almighty Father. The dove representing the Holy Ghost hovering above them. Incense was showered upon all at prayers before every picture. I could not discover the great difference between this &amp; mass in the Roman church, tho the Greek church professes such a wide distinction. the prayers were in an unknown tongue rapidly run over (except that for the Imperial family) the cross &amp; beads I only saw in the hands of the high Priest - or Bishop probably - his vestments much like those worn at Mass by dignitaries at the Roman Altar, but the long black robes of all the other brotherhood were more like nuns robes &amp; their long hair parted in the middle gave them quite a feminine appearance.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-589-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-589">589</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">&nbsp;&nbsp;On our drive home we observed all the peasantry along the Mackadamised road busy watering it, using small buckets filled with mud from the ditches on either side of the Turnpike, for it becomes very dusty in a few hours. I looked up at the clouds &amp; said to Debo “if they will wait a half hour it will be sprinkled from above,” but we concluded the Emperor must be expected at Peterhoff as had been reported in the morning. we did not meet him however, but after our tea there was a commotion on the road I joined our boys at the gate, for never having seen his Imperial Majesty I was willing to mingle in the throng of expectants. At last we learned when the company of Cadets were passing that the Emperor had only accompanied them as far as the Kras-na-kabac (or red drinking house)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-590-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-590">590</a></span></span> &amp; had gone back to town, his two little sons, the grand dukes Constantine &amp; some other name I forget,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-591-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-591">591</a></span></span> were in the ranks. they had all been regaled with tea &amp; good things on one or two of the Russian Estates in our neighbourhood &amp; had a march of 19 versts yet before they could reach the camp at Peterhoff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-592-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-592">592</a></span></span> - Poor little fellows I thought of them in the night while I listened to the pouring rain, &amp; knew they must be drenched to the skin. some of them were only from ten to twelve years old, but soldiers at heart. One of the officers had singled out our Jemmie &amp; asked him first in Russ then in French what regiment he belonged to? “None here I must wait to get again to my own country” Thus the 4<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> of July proved as exciting a day in Russia for our dear boys as it was no doubt to their cousins in Stonington. James is rather a trial to his mothers patience, but I hope will reward my perseverance when his character developes further, he is so eager in the pursuit of all that interests him. I now adopt the plan of hearing my dear boys read directly after breakfast. Willie first while James practises on the piano half an hour, them [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] Jem who hinders me not a little by his questions, he was much amused this morning on remarking that much which was said of the Russian character in touching upon the life of Peter the Czar, had come under his own observation.

I counted 24 varieties in full bloom, from the violet to the dahlia — We had promised to go with the Ropes to Sairgay chapel, it being S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Johns day<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-596-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-596">596</a></span></span> the chaunting would be finer than usual &amp; so it proved, for the band of court singers were added to those we had heard before, the chaunting was the most perfectly harmonious singing I ever listened to, but Oh I have the painful conviction that this worship is not that which is right the poor people prostrate themselves seemingly soul &amp; body. but their offerings are to Saints equally with the Saviour, who has said Look unto <span class="CharOverride-1">Me</span> &amp; be ye saved all the ends of the earth, for there is none else but <span class="CharOverride-1">me</span> who can come between you &amp; an offended God.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-597-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-597">597</a></span></span> the higher classes seemed to cross themselves without devotion gazing round upon the assembling crowd &amp; I observed the high Priest while his back was turned to the people take out a pocket comb &amp; smooth his long beard! this was in the most solemn part of the service, for he immediately after turned to his flock as Moses might have done to the Israelites to deliver a communication to them from the Most High,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-598-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-598">598</a></span></span> for as he hurried thro something in the Sclavonic, they all fell on their faces on the pavement. There were more tapers than common sold, dozen [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] were burning before the Saint Sairgay (this picture has a tiara of real diamonds &amp; its richly gilded frame corresponds with that of the blessed Saviour on the other side of the altar &amp; has even greater homage pd to it.

I was thankful I had listened to it before I heard that my sister was actually at the English Quai, when my mind reverted to the past, my own arrival &amp; its attendant trial! I could not restrain the impatience of Jemmie to meet Aunt Alicia he was flying off from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes yard without leave! so I called him back &amp; we drove round tho I feared it was only to encounter the crowd which always collects, for none around allowed to go on board the boat, tho the police may long detain their friends during their examination, happily for us however we soon saw luggage passing to the Custom house &amp; thro the favour shewn M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes my Sister was in a few moments in our carriage, leaving her keys for them to open her trunks without her, we went again to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes &amp; soon he brought the Harrisons I was so much pleased with her amiable, sensible, countenance I kissed her welcome &amp; her darling little girl of 4 years old &amp; boy of 6<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-605-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-605">605</a></span></span> most attractive, docile &amp; neat children, how pleased I was that they did not resist my embraces. I really am proud of the appearance of these Americans. And as we rode out on the Peterhoff road how eager James &amp; Willie were to shew off to Aunt Alicia all the novelties, distributing tracts to the soldiers they were sure would interest — Debo who had preceded us in M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gillebrands carriage was the first to imprint a kiss of welcome upon my dear Sisters lips. After dinner while she took a nap for she had been up since three oclock, I read to the little Normans &amp; my boys as usual.

Showers commenced again today, but the sun shines so gloriously between them &amp; the atmosphere is so transparent my Sister cannot but notice it. I ordered the Calash &amp; went with her to town to call upon the Harrisons &amp; also upon Miss Hirst taking only little Willie with us. We sat an hour with my invalid friend who was so cheered at receiving one from Preston so highly recommended as my Sister &amp; as a follower of our Lord that I never knew her so animated, I feared she would suffer for talking so much, afterwards, but she said “Never mind the suffering, that I am used to let me enjoy the present treat” twinges of pain often took her breath for a moment. My Sister said on leaving the house it was as if we had been visiting a being of a better world &amp; that the celestial expression of Miss Hirsts countenance increased the happy effect. We drove up into the Nevski after crossing the bridge, to get some drawing paper for James at the palet de Raphael,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-608-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-608">608</a></span></span> then told the driver Ne Dacha,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-609-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-609">609</a></span></span> on our road home we had a slight sprinkle. In the afternoon the beautiful M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Anderson &amp; her guests called to propose a drive thro some fine grounds &amp; to take tea with them afterwards. I declined, but Debo went with them. We had wild strawberries (the first) at tea, our Willie wished he knew where they grew, he would go to gather more! When I had seen my boys in bed I accompanied Aunt Alicia in a call upon our neighbours, she was charmed by their kindness, we found their pastor M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ellerby &amp; his lady<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-610-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-610">610</a></span></span> there, also Miss Mac Masters<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-611-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-611">611</a></span></span> &amp; her pupils the little Woods,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-612-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-612">612</a></span></span> come to make a visit of a fortnight at the Gellibrands. We were obliged to leave them at 10 oclock as I had promised to send the Droshky then for Debo. while my Sister &amp; I sat waiting for her (after we had had prayers with Mary) we naturally spoke of that little one who had been our delight when together at dear Uncle Winstanleys at Preston.</p>

When we assembled at prayers our dear boy came out of his fathers office - instead of just down stairs - where he had been shut up with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hadenskoff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-614-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-614">614</a></span></span> since six oclock! at some mysterious employment, it was solved when we went to breakfast under each plate was a note to each,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-615-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-615">615</a></span></span> mine tho not his own composition<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-616-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-616">616</a></span></span> as the others were, was so beautifully expressive of love to a mother that I felt as last Christmas day, quite overcome by the <span class="CharOverride-1">surprise</span> &amp; as the lines were my darling Jemmies own selection I shall copy them, that he may be reminded of his happy childhood when perhaps his grateful mother is not with him. </p>

			<p class="Body-Text">As I contrast my darling James healthful appearance with his last years palid looks I feel the mercy of Him who holds our lives in His keeping &amp; pray my dear boys may be prolonged to His honor upon Earth, then it will surely be to the comfort of his mother. Of course no school today! but a determined rain kept Willie &amp; James within doors. Aunt Alicia, Sister &amp; I answered the notes<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-618-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-618">618</a></span></span> while dear father had to drive off to town. A strawberry treat to all the children in the neighbourhood had been proposed to commemorate James birth day. but it so happened that a birth day at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Drurys<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-619-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-619">619</a></span></span> had engaged all there and the Normans, so when M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gillebrand sent to invite us boys and all to tea at her house we agreed to go there. This is a great Russian holiday 29<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>June old style,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-620-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-620">620</a></span></span> but what it is for I do not understand, only no business is attended to in the city therefore all the gents of the Ropes &amp; Gillebrand clans are in the country today. &amp; our boys will have a fine romp — they always expect it when M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes is at home</p>

M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes &amp; Miss M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span> Master came in to listen. It was amusing at bed time to see with what care my husband wiped his flute &amp; put it away in its case, giving it into my keeping, theives in this country often plead an excuse for stealing by complaining that valuables are left in their way to tempt them! what a pity we had not put the dear <span class="CharOverride-1">old</span> flute &amp; my pretty escrotoire beyond their reach.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Sat [July] 13<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-622-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-622">622</a></span></span> After the tremendous rains of the two past days the sun came out upon a clear blue sky today &amp; Whistler agreed to Debos proposal to take herself &amp; our dear boys to town, as she wished to go to Worronzoffs<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-623-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-623">623</a></span></span> for a new muslin dress. While they were away I was occupied looking after the ways of my household, little Andrea &amp; his mother came, I set her to scrubbing for I do think it wrong to encourage a system of begging. some jugglers came to the yard, little Andrea put me so in mind of my own precious Kirkie as he ran to me on tip toe with his fingers in his mouth looking half timid, half assured I could not deny him, with those full black eyes speaking so much more intelligibly than his Russian tongue! I opened the door for him, seated him there and threw out some kopeeks for the organist.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-624-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-624">624</a></span></span> My sister Alice brought her work to my room, three gents came up the front walk, the Pratchka (or Laundress)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-625-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-625">625</a></span></span> was washing windows in the dining room &amp; would have been frightened away had I not told her “Nee tchevo”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-626-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-626">626</a></span></span> so we went to the drawing room with M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> Joseph Ropes &amp; his two cousins,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-627-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-627">627</a></span></span> one had lately arrived from America &amp; it proved that his brother M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hooper had been in Whistlers employ in Springfield.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-628-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-628">628</a></span></span> The party came back from town, in time for little Willie &amp; I to take an hours walk with Aunt Alicia before dinner. In the afternoon while we were reading the Conquest of Mexico, we were not aware that M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W Maingay passed my room window, but when tea was ready found him seated in the parlor with Whistler. he &amp; Debo played Duetts on the harp &amp; piano (how Emma would have laughed had she listened to her brothers attempts) until eleven oclock — the twilight is so deceptive they were surprised to discover how late it was, but Whistler &amp; I were each occupied with a book, &amp; dear Aunt Alicia had long since stolen off to watch her darling James who was obliged to go to bed with a bad head ache. I received a most affectionate note from my friend Miss Hirst<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-629-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-629">629</a></span></span> in return for a form of calves foot I had sent her by them to town. how much I wished to go with it that I might read to her, she is so feeble again. And I always feel it such a benefit to myself to read the Scriptures to her. I forgot to remark this day (the 1<span class="CharOverride-9">st</span> of July old style the Empress birth day) is the greatest holiday in the year in Russia, there has always been in this reign, a grand féte at Peterhoff to celebrate it,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-630-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-630">630</a></span></span> but the illness of the Grand duchess Alexandra interferes with all gaiety at court now. We hear the flattering hope that she was better has proved false, her feeble frame could not bear longer than one night in the cow house, but she has been removed to the little lodge next the dairy.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-631-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-631">631</a></span></span> God has found it best to withold his blessing on all the means as yet tried. I trust He has better things in store for her than a restoration to health could enable her to enjoy. Oh may she put her trust in Him.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Sunday [July] 14<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-632-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-632">632</a></span></span> A fine bright morning for us to drive into town to attend divine service &amp; an excellent discourse from our young pastor as usual, it was upon Charity, his text was taken from Mat 26<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ </span>13<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-633-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-633">633</a></span></span> and while he urged upon us to relieve the necessities of the poor in this land, he besought us not to forget our duty to the spiritual claims of those in all lands especially in our own. I never enjoyed uniting in commemorating the dying love of our Lord &amp; Saviour at His holy table so much as on this sabbath M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Williams low &amp; solemn tone is so devotional. &amp; as there were very few, the altar only three times filled, he repeated to each member separately the whole verse, thus allowing time for private prayer, my soul felt strengthened &amp; refreshed. In the afternoon we had rain but not enough to prevent the little Normans coming to my room from the cottage to listen to my Sunday exercises with my dear boys.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Wed [July] 17<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-634-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-634">634</a></span></span> My sister &amp; self went to town with Whistler yesterday &amp; had some rain to encounter for not 24 hours is without this <span class="CharOverride-1">cold</span> summer. It was to attend to the exchange of her passport for a billet of residence, no stranger may sojourn in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P without this tax.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-635-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-635">635</a></span></span> Col Bouttatz joined us as had been agreed, for in all such cases he is ready to serve us. We had first to go to the Count Benkindoffs<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-636-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-636">636</a></span></span> &amp; as his house is almost a palace, he lives surrounded by palaces (near the Summer gardens<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-637-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-637">637</a></span></span> which the plentiful rains render uncommonly beautiful this season) so my Sister had a view of the finest part of the city, indeed we made a complete circuit before arriving at the Bureau for Strangers, while she went in to prove her identity I sat in the carriage exercising my Russ by reading the signs. We afterwards spent two hours at the bed side of dear Miss Hirst while Whistler went to the Railroad department, the Col promised to visit us. And as Col Todd also had told Whistler he would be with us this Wednesday, he made up his mind to be at home all day, however we had just finished breakfast when old M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Curtis stopped at our door to say he was on his way to Sairgay Monastery &amp; begged us to take seats in his carriage, as the chaunting would be uncommonly fine &amp; the ceremonies on S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Sairgays day<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-638-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-638">638</a></span></span> brilliant. Debo persuaded Aunt Alicia to chaperone her notwithstanding her horror of going to such a place of worship &amp; as they were early &amp; met an old admiral<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-639-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-639">639</a></span></span> who knew M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> C they procured places, tho hundreds could not gain admittance, as was the case of my husband &amp; self, for he not having heard the chaunting of the Greek service ever, was induced to follow them, knowing he would be back in time to receive Col Todd. As we pressed our way thro the crowd in the chapel yard, a grand procession of priests &amp; bishops came out, most magnificently dressed in light blue velvet inlaid with silver they looked so new we concluded they were so for the occasion. the higher order of the brotherhood wore splendid crowns glittering with diamonds &amp; other precious stones &amp; pearls, they showered incense on the prostrate crowd, &amp; carried wax tapers lighted in their hands. but there was not apparently the least feeling in the clergy that they were worshippers of a great High Priest &amp; the people looked with such awe upon them one might have thought they were their deities. Many hundreds were there &amp; many Splendid equipages, the field opposite the church was filled with carriages of all descriptions &amp; we understood many had been there from the night before. Oh if we could collect a multitude to join in our simple &amp; pure form of worship to hear the word of truth happy would it be for them! Debo did not return home till after us, the Emperors carriage had passed theirs! I always just miss the sight! it was supposed he was on his way to Peterhoff, but we afterwards heard from an eye witness of his unexpected entrance thro the crowd into the Chapel,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-640-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-640">640</a></span></span> when he asked for an especial service &amp; prayers for his dear daughter the Grand duchess. As he knelt before the Altar in his devotions his tears were observed to flow, &amp; all around him were struck to see the great man so humbled, &amp; his form wasting thro grief, that she who a few months past was his pride as he gave her at the Altar a blooming bride to the young Prince of Hesse Castle should now be sinking into an early grave.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-641-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-641">641</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Curtis spent the day with us, but tho we waited for Col Todd, he did not arrive to dine with us, he came in his coach &amp; four at six introducing young Parker<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-642-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-642">642</a></span></span> who brought a letter from M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Mac Swift,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-643-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-643">643</a></span></span> we were right glad to chat with him about the Chews,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-644-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-644">644</a></span></span> he is an intelligent, modest young gentleman, we were surprised to hear his travelling companion thro Europe is Col Thayer.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-645-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-645">645</a></span></span> It so happened that M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Miller came in to tea, and our friend Bouttatz was true to his promise &amp; arrived just as we were surrounding the table, he stayed with us tonight. the boys are delighted.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thurs [July] 18<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>By 6 oclock this morning Col B<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-646-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-646">646</a></span></span> was in our garden. Whistler felt timid about imposing our form of prayer upon him &amp; would have had family worship in retirement, but I felt we might pursue our usual course of assembling in the parlor without exhibition, for I have a dread of aught which might approach to <span class="CharOverride-1">being ashamed</span> of <span class="CharOverride-1">Jesus</span> in the world. Our kind friend knelt with us, &amp; I have no doubt at breakfast he listened to my boys verses of scripture with approbation, for he loves children so much, he must like to see them trained in the paths of peace, he was even unusually gentle &amp; kind, told them of his amusement in the garden in watching the old turkey with her family of young turkeys &amp; ducks &amp; chickens! she seemed so uneasy, with so many different <span class="CharOverride-1">sorts</span> to take care of. We had most tremendous rains today, I really suffer from cold not being able to go out for exercise.</p>

As M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Gellibrand or Ropes could not meet our American friends at dinner, we invited the ladies to come with them to tea, &amp; as M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Curtis brought a German M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Thal<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-649-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-649">649</a></span></span> sans ceremonie, we had quite a parlor full. much music of course as the two last are Amateurs. I sometimes tremble lest dear Debos music should prove a snare to draw her into too much notice &amp; consume too much of her precious time.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Sat [July] 20<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-650-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-650">650</a></span></span> I put on a good warm cloak when I seated myself beside Whistler in the droshky this morning. with a form of Jelly to take to my invalid friend. I parted from him at the bridge as he was bound for Alexandrofski, but on my alighting at M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hirsts gate I was disappointed to hear my poor suffering friend was in too much pain to see me, it was the first time I had ever been denied admittance. I went into the Summer house in the pretty garden &amp; her good Elona provided me with writing materials that I might leave a few lines of affection &amp; sympathy to comfort her, when able to read them. Rain came powerfully soon after my safe arrival at home, the house becomes so chilly we often are glad of the heat from one Peach, so in anticipation of my gude mons return I ordered that in the dining room, &amp; he approved of it when he came at tea time.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday [July] 22<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-651-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-651">651</a></span></span> Yesterday morning we were again favored with clear weather. the subject of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams discourse was luke warmness in our devotions &amp; service to the Saviour! Ah how well for a congregation when a preacher fearlessly points this lamentable fact for our consideration. In the afternoon the rain was very determined there was no holding up between the showers when the little Normans could run in to join James &amp; William in our sabbath reading. Whistler &amp; Aunt Alicia however listened with them to the instructive narritive of Archie Stewart.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-652-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-652">652</a></span></span> and in the evening Debo read one of Blunts excellent sermons upon the life of S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Paul to us. What a transition there was during last night in the weather! tremendous rolling of thunder awoke us all accompanying heavy rain, which has carried off the cold &amp; brought us back a Summers heat, which even I feel quite oppressive, but I will not complain. the farmers are rejoicing &amp; the hay makers are very busy trying to dry some of the grass which they had every prospect of losing thro the incessant rains. This is my darling Willies 8<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> Anniversary, he &amp; James have no lessons &amp; seem as lively as the birds among their numerous little friends. Of course we had each a note from Will for our breakfast, as he would not be out done by James.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-653-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-653">653</a></span></span> And I have been very busy all this morning bargaining with the fruiters for their strawberry feast A long table spread for a dozen, now collected in our grounds. the little Russian children are remarkably well behaved &amp; polite, so that my boys have both pleasure &amp; profit in such companions as the Druries. On rising from table they invariably come up to the lady &amp; of the house to tender thanks with a graceful bow or courtesy</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Wed [July] 24<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-654-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-654">654</a></span></span> Fine warm weather continues. Yesterday my Sister &amp; self went to the city with Whistler directly after breakfast, as Miss Hirst had expressed a wish we should partake of the Communion with her, but as we could not so early venture into a sick room we went to our house upon the English Quai,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-655-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-655">655</a></span></span> where we found workmen busy at repairs. the view of the Neva now such a busy, gay, scene, is delightful from the balcony, but my husband is dissatisfied with our new accommodations, the lodgings like all in Russia are more for display than convenience, and Whistler could not help contrasting the rough corners, with the gilded cornises &amp; painted ceilings. Ah how comfortable are the snug homes of America &amp; England! still in Russia we have many domestic arrangements to reconcile us, the servants so respectful &amp; willing. I will take the evil with the good every where, for it must be mingled upon earth. Sister &amp; I took a gondola at the ferry steps opposite the Ritter House where our new quarters are, and were so attracted by the beauty of a Steamer on its way up the river we did not notice our little boat was crossing its wake until the tossing made us fear a capsize, my heart was in my throat &amp; my Sister who is timid screamed “Mercy” while the oarsman or Pirasvostschi<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-656-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-656">656</a></span></span> quietly said “Neetcheevo” or never mind &amp; tho I trembled I felt it was a false alarm. We walked slowly up to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hirsts, (after paying our 5 cop-silv<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-657-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-657">657</a></span></span> ferriage which certainly was little enough for two crossing in a gaily painted barge under a nice awning) the heat tho not quite so intense as yesterday was enough. The dear Invalid was very feeble, the doctor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-658-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-658">658</a></span></span> who had just left her had prohibited her saying a word, indeed she could scarcely whisper, but tho so low, she looked the picture of neatness &amp; the slight flush on her cheek tho painful is beautiful to gaze up. she pointed to a book of Prayers for the Sick (by bishop Slade)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-659-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-659">659</a></span></span> &amp; I read the portions which were most appropriate from time to time. Never shall I forget the privilige of partaking of the sacred emblems of our Lords love for us, with one so truly waiting upon Him. I felt that He was indeed among us. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams performed the service most feelingly, but as she was too feeble to converse promised to visit her again the next day to pray with her. We remained a while after him &amp; found Whistler at the Quai waiting for us. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Stockoll<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-660-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-660">660</a></span></span> drove out to tea &amp; spent the evening till midnight! on our piazza. This morning looked unpropitious for Whistlers trip to Cronstadt with our American friends, but he left home by 8 oclock supposing Col Thayer would be expecting him.

Indeed I could not be so selfish as to wish him back again, my most earnest desire is that those still lent me may feel that they are only pilgrims here, I have no earthly ambitious views for them but that as faithful followers of the Saviour they may be as lights in the paths of holiness &amp; peace.</p>

The only evening I have been out this summer except at our neighbours the Gellibrands was last week at the request of the beautiful M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Anderson to keep her wedding day<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-668-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-668">668</a></span></span> I was surprised to meet so many there, W<span class="CharOverride-9">m</span> Maingay came among the others from town &amp; brought me the pleasure of a few lines from his dear mother,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-669-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-669">669</a></span></span> for his father has come to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg from London. In the long twilight the young people walked about the grounds &amp; engaged in Russian games, Debo stole away to take a peep at Emmas letters.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-670-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-670">670</a></span></span> I wished my Jemmie &amp; Willie could see the Shetland pony fed from the hand of the Anderson boys,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-671-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-671">671</a></span></span> so tame it follows them all over the house — As the piazza &amp; trees were hung with colored lamps they had to be lit &amp; then we adjourned to the music hall a lofty spacious room extending across the front of the house, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Anderson put me in mind of the picture of some Circassian maid<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-672-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-672">672</a></span></span> as she sung to her guitar &amp; her black eyes looked so melting, the bloom of her cheek so soft &amp; rich, but her greatest attraction is her unaffected sweetness of manner, she certainly is gifted, for I would rather hear her sing than any one I ever listened to, but yet my heart still holds my own dear Debo above all I contrast her with among these who assemble to be gay &amp; I was so grateful to her when she declined waltzing! I hope she never will yeild to her fondness for dancing at the expense of what I conceive to be decorous. Our evening was concluded with assembling around a table for fruits &amp; champagne. Water melons from Astracan!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-673-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-673">673</a></span></span> scarlet strawberries from the Andersons own garden. But I must not linger over the last week when I have to record so much of this. My dear friend Miss Hirst has been daily growing more ill, last Sunday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-674-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-674">674</a></span></span> I sent her a form of Jelly before church &amp; a bunch of flowers from my little Willie accompanied it, I was surprised that she should write me an acknowledgement. but she is so grateful! the doct came to see my James on Monday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-675-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-675">675</a></span></span> but was in great haste as Miss Hirst was so extremely ill her brother had been sent for, I could scarcely sleep that night thinking of her &amp; the next day<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-676-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-676">676</a></span></span> went to the city with my husband to offer my services at her bedside, I found poor Elona overwhelmed with sorrow for her suffering mistress, never shall I forget the patience of this true christian, she raised her eyes to heaven as if imploring strength, which surely was yeilded or she could not have endured without uttering a complaint what she did, at times when she could scarcely breathe for pain she would be raised in her brothers arms &amp; rest her feeble head on his shoulder, she seemed burning up with fever &amp; it was a mercy that she could from time to time take the smallest lump of ice in her mouth, as she could not swallow half a teaspoon full of water. But why depict her sufferings - except to shew the support of religion, when she could speak she would say to me “give me comfort” I cannot do without the word of God” — her moans were heart rending, we all wept silently at sufferings we could not remove, even her brother was often unmanned, then she would so gently say “Why distress yourself dear brother? you do all in your power, God comfort you!” And in the midst of all her agonies she was so considerate for us it was truly touching, she would point to a seat that her Sister might rest while I fanned her &amp; I heard her trying to utter an order to the nurse to bring me a glass of nice cold milk, which she had used to like to see me enjoy. I did not leave her till eight in the evening, &amp; as I walked sadly backwards &amp; forwards in the 5<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Line<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-677-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-677">677</a></span></span> to catch a sight of our carriage &amp; prevent its rattling up to the gate I had the happiness of seeing my dear husband walking to meet me, we crossed the Neva in a little boat &amp; were soon on our road home, we found the Ropes &amp; music — I dont know a much more trying transitio[n] than mine proved my heart was sadder than ever as the Piano, Harp &amp; Flute drew forth harmonies — to delight the rest, &amp; I was thankful when we could all kneel around the family Altar &amp; retire to our rooms. On Wednesday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-678-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-678">678</a></span></span> we had a visit for the first time from our Pastor M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams, introduced to tea sociably. they came in unexpectedly &amp; were listening to Debo &amp; her father playing a sweet duett ere they were discovered, Debo was rather shocked for she had heard that M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> W was not fond of music. I told her it must be only the excess (of spending whole mornings in practising &amp; evenings in exhibition) which he could not help dissapproving, &amp; so it proved, he asked for sacred music, which alas she could not gratify him with, but he urged her to practise some he should send, &amp; remarked that he wished every one of his congregation who had voices would use them freely in church to drown the wretched singing of the German boys who compose our choir, he lamented that the chaunts were not sung in church &amp; said, he by comparison, had never known the beauty of the Psalms of David<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-679-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-679">679</a></span></span> until he heard them in the Cathedral service. Thus our young Clergyman proved himself not only a connissier but an Amateur of the divine science of music, but he has been like many other christians greived that the gift has been devoted only to worldly amusement, &amp; witheld from approving the pervertion of the talent. No expence has been spared by the English Factory to make their Chapel all it ought to be, a new splendid Organ<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-680-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-680">680</a></span></span> for which they pd a thousand pound, a hired organist,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-681-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-681">681</a></span></span> but as a young lady observed truly the other day the congregation rather praise God by proxy! M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams urges them to join in the responses &amp; the hymns, which I have ventured always to do at the expense of being called a disturber of the awful silence! Debo &amp; Whistler seemed to enjoy the cheerfulness &amp; intelligence of our young pastor, my boys were attracted by his playful remarks about good children in church while Aunt Alicia was charmed with his accounts of Syria &amp; Greece, he spoke of our missionaries M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Southgate<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-682-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-682">682</a></span></span> &amp; Hill<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-683-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-683">683</a></span></span> with deep interest &amp; said M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hill<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-684-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-684">684</a></span></span> was the most astonishing woman he ever met with, her school at Athens<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-685-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-685">685</a></span></span> I have ever been interested in &amp; supposed her energy in carrying on her course of instruction to the heathen was what he lauded, but no it was her sweet dependence upon God, her devotion her faith &amp; simplicity. The Gellibrands came in after tea, D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Handysides<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-686-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-686">686</a></span></span> asked for Scotch music &amp; seemed quite enraptured by the accompaniment of my husbands flute to Debos piano. I observed our clerical guest had become wrapped in reflection. I thought of the close of our evenings at Stonington when dear M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Newman<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-687-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-687">687</a></span></span> had been our guest &amp; longed for a pause in the music that I might consult my husband about asking for prayers ere we separated. When there was a movement as if to say goodnight I could wait no longer &amp; whispering M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams my wish that he should conduct our family devotions I placed the bible in his hands, as he read from Ephesians,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-688-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-688">688</a></span></span> he made some appropriate [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] remarks after which he prayed most fervently. I have not felt so comforted since I left my own dear mother &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">her home</span>. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> G drew aside &amp; commended me for what I had done saying he should follow my example in his own house, but after I had retired to my room Whistler was silent. today he has talked with me about it, &amp; has been uncomfortable lest our deviating from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Laws practise should bring remarks upon him. May God direct us what is our duty! I feel that every Pastor might desire to close every visit thus, &amp; as I am not afraid of any remarks upon my own conduct if I do not bring censure upon others, I shall hope to enjoy again this my share of the visit of our Pastor again. And now after the interruption of visiters I will close this days account. Col Melnikoff &amp; his brother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-689-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-689">689</a></span></span> (who holds some situation at court) came rather unexpectedly to dine with us today, for a rare event my husband was at home, having been writing an important document for Count K, so we made no strangers of them, Debos fluency in the french tongue is a great advantage here, she conversed entirely with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M, I have felt a stronger desire than ever to acquire a knowledge of french since my predicament when this gentlemans wife<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-690-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-690">690</a></span></span> called one day in the Galernia upon me &amp; we could not say a word to be understood by each other — About 8 clock in the evening the Andersons came also, these gents became so enchanted by the music, especially the voice of the beautiful M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> A they could scarcely tear themselves away at ten oclock tho they had to ride nearly 20 versts. They begged Whistler to let them come soon again to our country retreat “there is so much more enjoyment in visiting thus sociably, Madame M, would find it so!”</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Friday Aug 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-691-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-691">691</a></span></span> This day has been in strong contrast to yesterday, yet I always feel on visiting Miss Hirst it is better to spend an hour at her bed side than in the most joyous circle, for I feel Gods presence there. this dear lady has been sinking in bodily strength rapidly &amp; I have scarcely expected to find her breathing from time to time, my sister only went with me to town today as Whistler was still busy with his rail road document at home, she feared to intrude into the sick chamber &amp; sauntered about the garden, the low moans of the sufferer sunk upon my heart as I approached her room, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hirst sat fanning her, silently weeping. I thought to relieve her while I could stay &amp; took the fan, the dear invalid knew I was there, tho when she spoke it was with so much exertion &amp; in so feeble a tone I could only hear her say “Give me comfort” read the word of God to me” a choise collection of prayers &amp; texts always shared her table with her favorite flowers, she never valued any thing but in connection with her Saviour, she did while able to admire them, read in every petal His goodness &amp; indulgence to mankind. And now could not exist without His word. I would not be irreverent! but as I witnessed her agonies this day I thought perhaps since those He suffered on the cross none could have been more severe or lingering than hers. but I know it passeth human knowledge to judge of the agonies of His soul for the sins of the whole world! — At times she had to be lifted in good Elonas arms to breathe, the dreadful disease having reached her throat she could not even swallow the water from the tiny lump of ice, while the surface of her body appeared consuming with heat, her feet could not bear even the linen sheet, they looked delicate as an infants, it is five years since she has stood upon them! Oh how often have I had my patient little suffering Kirkie before my minds eye this day! If God permits the “little ones” He loves thus to be afflicted how hateful must sin be in His sight. He scourges every Son whom He receiveth,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-692-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-692">692</a></span></span> Oh how dangerous is death bed repentance! Oh that we might all give our hearts to Him in their freshness to be kept by Him as Miss Hirst did, her soul stayed on Him was free from terrors, her mind perfectly clear unto the last. After a paroxysm of great pain, when she could speak she asked me to read a prayer. I knelt beside her, &amp; felt Oh so humbled! wondering that <span class="CharOverride-1">I</span> should be permitted to comfort such a saint, &amp; as I repeated the Lords prayer at the close of one I had read for a person near death, my emotion so entirely overpowered me, that she gently laid her hand upon my head &amp; soothed me! Strength was lent her to fulfil her last desires, she distinctly said “I could like to kiss your Sister before I go” she put her feeble arms about me &amp; blessed me &amp; as she called over the names of my husband &amp; children seemed to breathe a prayer for them, which may God of His infinite goodness answer! then taking M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hirsts hand she placed it in mine &amp; said “promise me you will transfer the love you have shewn to me, to this Sister” I did so heartily, then she thanked me &amp; blessed me again for the comfort I had been always to her &amp; added “God brought you here, for He had work for you to do,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-693-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-693">693</a></span></span> then alluding to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams visits, she added “I told you love, God was multiplying my blessings at the last of my days on earth” she embraced my Sister affectionately calling her her sister in Christ Jesus. We all wept thro this exciting hour but herself. I knew she must rapidly sink after it &amp; whispering M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʀ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Hirst, that I felt these precious moments should be sacred to themselves, moved as if to go, she called be [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] once more to kiss &amp; to bless me, then waved her hands as if to consent to my leaving her, whispered “If I live you will see me again, farewell now my love” I feel that this is our last interview on earth! If I ever enter that state of perfect happiness which I feel is awaiting her, I shall know if I am in error now, in imagining the joy of my children in welcoming to the skies their mothers friend! We shall know each other, even as we are known<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-694-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-694">694</a></span></span> “Oh that this reunion might ever be our <span class="CharOverride-1">strongest</span> wish, that the trifles of earth might not enchain our desires. but Jesus must become the object of our supreme attachment or our affections can never mount on high, And His word must be our chief study, that in this life we may honor Him, or He will say at the awful day of Judgement “I know you not” — <span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-695-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-695">695</a></span></span> Oh that we appreciated how precious is <span class="CharOverride-1">time</span>.</p>

I found both M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hirst in the sick chamber, the patient had not opened her mouth since Sat morning at 3 oclock — Oh how emaciated by suffering! I kissed her for the last time, yet she opened not her eyes. I hastened over to church as her brother desired the prayers of the church &amp; it was too late to send a servant. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ </span>Ellerby had had to accompany his sick wife to Revel,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-698-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-698">698</a></span></span> so his flock were added to our scanty number &amp; the church was respectably filled, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams text was from the 19<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>chap 18<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>verse 1<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Kings.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-699-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-699">699</a></span></span> it was liked by all of his <span class="CharOverride-1">mingled</span> auditors for it was full of charity &amp; brotherly love. I have just heard from M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hirst that her dear Sister was last night released! she is to be buried on thursday next,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-700-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-700">700</a></span></span> she had seemed free from suffering many hours before she ceased to breathe, but neither spoke, or opened her eyes, all her worldly cares were over on friday &amp; I do not doubt she held sweet communion with Jesus, while to observers she had ceased to notice any thing around her. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ropes has just told me of a very afflicted Mother who lives about 4 versts off. I never saw M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hodges,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-701-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-701">701</a></span></span> &amp; from the style of her living should never have wished to visit at her house, for almost every Sunday they had a dinner party. but now I am drawn by sympathy towards her &amp; wish I could go to her to weep with her. she had one of the dearest little babies who last Saturday afternoon was frolicing at her knee, it was taken uneasy that night &amp; last night after hours of suffering died!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-702-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-702">702</a></span></span> Ah how like this case to my little Charlies! he was the brightest of my family group on Saturday &amp; the following night his eyes were glazed by death! God deals with us very gently, He takes these little innocents around whom He knows our tenderest affections are entwined, &amp; it is well with us to be afflicted, but woe if we harden our hearts &amp; turn to the world for comfort, then the next blow from our Heavenly Father must be more severe to make us feel our risk in delaying repentance. I am told M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hodson is a most fond mother &amp; this is the first death in her family of little ones. May the affections of all the rest follow it!</p>

I have just done feasting on Stonington news, my dear brother &amp; all but Mary were off for West Point. Oh how I should enjoy walking about there with dear Maria, I cannot believe a friend they write me is to be married upon the hasty engagement they say. J. D. P.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-710-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-710">710</a></span></span> is too prudent for such a rash measure. I have many times today thought of this being the anniversary of our loss of dear Henry. it is four years since that bright youth was so suddenly taken from us at Springfield, but my anguish of spirit then tho softened into a settled sorrow can never be obliterated. The anniversaries of those loved ones who have gone before us into eternity are as tenderly noted by my memory as the birth days of the dear boys left me. I did not write it, but all day the 10<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> of last month the scene of that Sabbath morning when we all stood around my Kirkies dying bed was vividly before me, two years have already passed since then &amp; the anniversaries of his own little Charlies birth &amp; death are rapidly approaching. Oh that those spared to me may live prepared to die!</p>

M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams read the burial service in the church with solemn feeling. There were eight pall bearers &amp; as we followed the sad train down the aisle I observed poor Elona dressed in black (wearing a neat mourning cap as servants in Russia do not wear bonnets) she was weeping most heartily, I really respected her grief &amp; sympathised in it for I had long seen proofs of her attachment I extended my hand across the pew to where she was, she pressed it as tho she would fain cling to me. Oh may the lessons she has learned from her dear Mistress continue to remind her to trust in God. As our horses could not take us to the Island where the burial ground belonging to the English Church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-713-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-713">713</a></span></span> is, my Sister &amp; I stood upon the balcony of our lodgings on the Quai &amp; watched the mournful procession cross the bridge.

The weather so propitious that Debos wish to go to church was granted, we all went, the sun shone so bright &amp; the air so clear I was sure it would continue fine as it did the whole day. I did not observe old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Leon<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-723-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-723">723</a></span></span> waiting at the church door to greet me, it would appear that the mantle of dear Miss Hirst has descended upon me, for so many thank me for my having resorted often to her sick room &amp; notice me as they never did before, they little know what a privilige I esteemed it that I was permitted to approach that blessed Saint. Old M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> L whispered also the news which had just reached town of the death of the Grand Duchess Alexandrine, it had occurred the day before she had died in giving birth to an infant.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-724-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-724">724</a></span></span> Not yet 19 years old, how early has closed her brilliant earthly career!

I never listened to a more impressive discourse in all my life than M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams gave us from 1<span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Kings again, “Hast thou found me Oh mine Enemy?”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-728-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-728">728</a></span></span> towards the conclusion he said, none but God could know how painful it was the Servant of God to denounce His judgements upon any, &amp; then spoke of the comfort experienced by the faithful Pastor among the sick or dying who leaned on the sure hope in a risen Saviour, to whisper consolation to the departing soul of a believer, to hold out the promise of those joys “which eye hath not seen, or ear heard”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-729-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-729">729</a></span></span> to tell of the golden crowns &amp; golden harps &amp; of that swell of harmony from the innumerable voices of that redeemed company who feel an eternal Sabbath not too long to sing the praise of Jesus. Oh how fervently our young preacher pleaded with us for Christs sake to be reconciled to God — After our cold dinner I collected the books &amp; children for my sunday school, I had an addition to our number in two nice lads of the family who took possession of the empty house on this estate last week — I read first a Sermon for children &amp; questioned them upon it, then made each of them read aloud to me from Scriptural Instruction for the least &amp; the lowest,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-730-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-730">730</a></span></span> &amp; was delighted with the behaviour of the new comers W<span class="CharOverride-9U">m</span> &amp; John Drury,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-731-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-731">731</a></span></span> so much gentleness &amp; reverence in their manner of reading. Before dismissing my little friends I regaled them with a dish of delicious cherries which had been kept in the ice house till almost like ices, then I gave them lessons to commit to memory for the next Sabbath.

The royal infant is to be taken to Denmark to be buried &amp; it is supposed the Prince of Hesse will soon return to Copenhagen. he is to receive the dowry &amp; jewels of his wife, the former is one million silver rubles, the jewels also must be be [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] very valuable, so the Prince will return to his court richer in money at least than when he came for his royal bride.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-735-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-735">735</a></span></span> As her death is the first that has occurred in the Imperial family since that of her Empress Aunt the wife of the Emperor Alexander<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-736-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-736">736</a></span></span> it is the first in twenty years! we feel interested to hear how her mother the present Empress bears it.</p>

When Whistler returned from town he reported having been to Sarsco to see the Col, he had a mind to remain in town tonight to witness the funeral procession by torch light. At this moment while I am so happy in listening to the voice of my dear daughter what grief there must be at the Palace, the body of that daughter &amp; sister &amp; <span class="CharOverride-1">young wife</span> is to be removed this evening to its narrow bed, it leaves Sarsco at 8 oclock &amp; is to be deposited in the old Fortress Church on the Island opposite S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg in the dead of night, it certainly would have been worth while to see so vast a procession moving by torch light,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-739-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-739">739</a></span></span> but Whistler never voluntarily remains from home. he has to leave us too soon to go to Moscow.

We were just in time to dress for dinner when Whistler arrived, &amp; also Col Bouttatz &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Stockol, my husband brought a letter from England containing much sad news, the death of Woodcock Winstanley<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-741-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-741">741</a></span></span> &amp; the extreme illness of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Rob<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Smith of Chaddock<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-742-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-742">742</a></span></span> The conversation in the drawing room of course turned upon the affliction of the Imperial family. the crowd which met them last evening at the gates was so great that the royal carriages could scarcely press their way thro, the Emperor was gratified by this manifestation of the sympathy of his subjects there was not any display in the conveying the corpse to the Fortress Church, it was only attended by the Imperial family.

I had hoped for one but was dissappointed! Today at eleven oclock my beloved husband bade me adieu for another fortnights absence to go to Moscow — Debo &amp; the boys went 7 versts with him to meet his travelling equipage. I tried to rejoice in the unusually fine weather, but my heart so oppressed with sadness refused, &amp; I retired to find comfort in communion with my Heavenly Father, &amp; in His word to seek direction. Oh that I could cast all my care upon Him, who pitieth my weakness &amp; who knoweth all my wants! It accorded not with my sadness to dress for a dinner party today, but for Debos &amp; Aunt Alicias enjoyment I fulfilled my engagement to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> F Baird.

We had a sumptuous entertainment, the courses handed round by the servants in Russian style,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-755-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-755">755</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Baird seems to have all the hospitality of our friend M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Dickerson.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-756-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-756">756</a></span></span> We adjourned to the Balcony after dinner for coffee &amp; to enjoy the extensive view of the Gulf of Finland. A variety of exotics lined the sides of this piazza, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> B complimented Debo by placing a bunch of Orange flowers in her hair. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams made quite a playful attack upon my daughter about the report she had circulated against his love of music, she very amiably acknowledged she was the author! In the course of the evening I had a téte a téte with our young Pastor, very much to my satisfaction for in it he thanked me for the way in which I had closed his evening at our house, remarking he felt he could do no good in visiting unless he was acknowledged as a servant of Christ &amp; he felt painfully that few circles realized that a clergyman was present even when he was invited to meet members of the Church. Now I trust my dear husband will not feel afraid of remarks upon our irregular proceedings if at the close of another evening I ask our pastor to lead our family devotions, for I know he wishes to honor God whenever a suitable occasion offers) M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams gave me an interesting account of a stranger who arrived in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg only last tuesday (with her husband the Capt of a vessel from Montrose Scotland &amp; who was left a widow on wednesday.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-757-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-757">757</a></span></span> he had visited her several times &amp; begged me to do so. I felt grateful again this evening to my dear Debo that she was not among the waltzers &amp; tho our Rev<span class="CharOverride-9">d</span> friend made no remark on the dancing I am sure she would not have retained his good opinion if she had been whirled among the giddy throng.

Afterwards when Debo at her request played, he said to me “Your daughter’s selection is so delightful &amp; her modest discretion in choosing short peices so remarkably I must think you have advised her, to induce her listeners always to wish she would not so soon leave the instrument, it is like temperance at a feast, our taste is never cloyed, — I did not detract from my gentle daughters merit by assuming any of the credit, due only to her innate delicacy. Indeed tho I make no outward demonstration, none can admire her as I do always when she mingles among the fashionables here. knowing as I do her power to shine &amp; win attention, I love to watch how unassuming she is compared to other young ladies We ordered our carriage when M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Law did hers at 10 oclock altho all cried out against the early hour.

As I had understood the funeral of Cap<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Roy was to be early, I might perhaps comfort his poor widow &amp; tho a stranger I ventured into the hotel in the Galernia. usually resorted to by English Sea Captains.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-766-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-766">766</a></span></span> I was not unwelcome to poor M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Roy. “I have met with a heavy affliction” was her first remark to me, but God has sent the staff with the rod,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-767-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-767">767</a></span></span> I trust it will prove for my good. perhaps I thought too much of my dear husband, he was a quiet man, I never heard him say a rough word to any one &amp; he never uttered an oath as some do to his sailors” She told me afterwards that she had only been six months married, after a seven years engagement, her husband had not been well &amp; that had induced her to embark with him, she often repeated how thankful she felt she had come to be with him at the last. she spoke of the merciful arrangement of Him who over rules all events in bringing also another Capt from Montrose to the same house, as she should now return in his vessel to her Sisters.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-768-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-768">768</a></span></span> she told me her husband had suffered so much during his few hours illness that she was made willing to let the Saviour take him from her, said he had repeated the Paraphrase from Job (the 188<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> hymn in our prayer book) “Few are thy days &amp;c<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-769-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-769">769</a></span></span> - &amp; had told her if God prolonged his days, how differently he should live, (yet he was a good man! had brought up &amp; educated several brothers,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-770-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-770">770</a></span></span> his marriage had been retarded that he might first work for them) When dying he repeated the 23<span class="CharOverride-9">rd</span> Psalm!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-771-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-771">771</a></span></span> I wished the poor bereaved widow to promise to go home with me after the funeral for it did not take place till two hours after my interview with her) I knew in our quiet life she might be undisturbed &amp; thought the rural scenes around us might accord with her feelings, but arrangements were making for her going back to her husbands vessel, she knew all his crew,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-772-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-772">772</a></span></span> they had loved him, they were from Montrose &amp; she had much to do for her voyage, so while she seemed grateful, she was firm in declining my proposal. I am sure I shall never lose the sweet impressions the converse of this widow made upon me, her simplicity, her deep piety, her gentle submission to the will of Him who cannot err! I went to comfort, &amp; instead received counsel to be treasured up against time of need, her Scotch accent &amp; her bible language made it seem like some tale of Lights &amp; Shadows of Scottish life,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-773-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-773">773</a></span></span> but it was to her a sad reality! Only last sunday they had made the port of Cronstadt in one short week how much she had been called upon to endure! My Sister said much to strengthen the faith of this humble christian &amp; our tears flowed while she wiped away her own as tho she dreaded making a display of her grief, to which at first tears had refused releif. We watched the funeral of the stranger as it wound its way across the bridge, while we stood upon our balcony at the English quai. My Sister preferred remaining there as she had a book, to crossing with me in a small boat to call on M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hirst. I had an opp- of gladdening another poor body without much trouble, a poor Russian girl was just seating herself in another boat, when seeing me she without ceremony sprung beside me the boat man would have lifted her back to her place, had I not said “Nee chee voo”,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-774-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-774">774</a></span></span> and when paying my own ferriage, I told her “Nee naa da”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-775-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-775">775</a></span></span> as she was about to offer her 10 kopeecks copper<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-776-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-776">776</a></span></span> &amp; settled for hers at the same time, she could hardly refrain from embracing me, such trifles are favors to the poor! she no doubt was a servant of the lowest order &amp; had been to the police to have her passport renewed,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-777-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-777">777</a></span></span> as she held it in her hand, she followed me thanking me in Russ as far as she could. I had my hot walk for nothing M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Hirst not returned from the country. As we had Marys trunk<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-778-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-778">778</a></span></span> to take home in our Calashe, we could not call on Miss Morgan. she was right glad to receive it, &amp; the boys brought one old thing after another for me to look at which had been thrown in when we were leaving Stonington Ah how keenly nursery scenes there presented themselves, No one knows how much I yet miss that little one whose soft voice memory brings to my ear the sweetest music to my heart.</p>

M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams preached from the 1<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƪ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>lesson, that beautiful history of Naaman, his text 12<span class="CharOverride-9">th</span> verse of 5<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> chap of 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Kings,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-780-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-780">780</a></span></span> he applied it most plainly &amp; forcibly to his hearers. I have not seen so full a congregation this summer. The Harrisons met us after church, I was glad to find them regular worshippers among us &amp; begged them also to attend M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams preaching at Alexandrofski.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-781-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-781">781</a></span></span> In the afternoon I had as usual my Sunday school collected in my parlor, I was most delighted with the new comers as my Willie calls the little Drurys next door. they had their bible recitation so perfect &amp; read in their turn so attentively, I kept them to tea, as I did the little inattentive Normans, for I wish to give them happy associations of the sabbath day kept as it ought to be, not as they have been accustomed to keep it. In the evening Debo read aloud one of Blunts sermons to Aunt Alicia &amp; I, Mary too came in.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Monday [August] 19<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-782-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-782">782</a></span></span> I have quite forgotten to note down my refreshing baths (at Drurys bath house in the wood opposite where there is a pond, this hot week past, but this morning being cloudy I did not go, we however ventured to set out to spend the day at the Harrisons notwithstanding the threatning of rain. We took Mary &amp; the boys, leaving Fedor to take care of the house, the ride to Alexandrofski did not prove as interesting as it was agreable, for it was just a succession of manufactories and little log houses after the bounds of S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-783-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-783">783</a></span></span> but the road was good &amp; the weather not too hot, the Harrisons gave us a cordial welcome they had feared rain would prevent our visit. What a delightful house is theirs!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-784-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-784">784</a></span></span> so spacious &amp; well built, we admired the pretty view up the Neva from the balcony of their drawing room, there is also water at the side of the house, for their extensive garden rises from the borders of a canal, we walked there eating fruit, until the sun shone out in his full strength at noon &amp; drove us in. I took a fancy to dear little Annie Harrison, she looks like a dark eyed sister of Johnny Barns<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-785-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-785">785</a></span></span> might, for she reminded us of him, &amp; me she made think of Kirkie, such splendid eyes &amp; forehead, rich dark ringlets and she is just the age he was when I lost him. Oh what a picture she was when she fell asleep at dinner, her bonnie cheek resting upon her arm, her unusual exercise with the boys in the garden had quite overpowered her, I stole away from the drawing room in the afternoon to look at her as she still slept on the sofa in the dining room. After M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> H had taken my boys to see M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winans at the works, we ladies were induced to accept his offer to shew us how they make Locomotives. It proved very interesting, certainly the Emperor will be much gratified when he visits them<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-786-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-786">786</a></span></span> &amp; sees all the improvements the Americans are making in his government iron works, so many fine machines they have imported from the U States &amp; from England. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Winans pointed out some of the American mechanics which have come over to join this establishment, they all looked well &amp; are contented<span class="Endnote-reference _idGenCharOverride-9"> </span>.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-787-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-787">787</a></span></span> We went down to the lower regions where they melt the iron &amp; waited to see the process of running it into the moulds for wheels &amp;c. My Sister grew frightened &amp; scampered off not knowing the men were bound for that very end of the building We had a heartly laugh at her expense when we observed them following her with the red hot liquid hemming her up in a corner while they poured it into the moulds ‘alls well that ends well”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-788-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-788">788</a></span></span> she good humouredly joined in the mirth. We were introduced to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Kirk (the lately married) he did not look like a gallant bride groom in this dirty region, but he said he had known our dear George as a lad in Lowell<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-789-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-789">789</a></span></span> &amp; I promised to call upon his wife when next I go to Alexandrofski, they occupy the house at the opposite side of the works corresponding with the Harrisons, Winans keeps batchelors hall in one story, certainly they have much to make their home in Russia delightful, Neva water conducted to every part of their houses, bath rooms, hot houses &amp; all such luxuries. I urged them all to begin as they ought to go on with regard to the Sabbath, which is so seldom hallowed here, and to lead all their English &amp; American mechanics to attend the service at the School room It certainly is the duty of each one of us, from the home of the Pilgrims to let our light shine, that those who dwell in darkness may learn to respect the commandments of God. The great work for each individual (no matter what the earthly calling of each) should be winning souls to Christ, &amp; we find this work to perform by precept &amp; example here. On our drive home we admired the splendour of the setting sun &amp; the ruby colored sky, our party prophesied a fair day tomorrow, but I thought this summer all old signs had failed. Jemmy kept up a conversation in Russ with the coachman. little Willie tho buttoned up to the throat in his English great coat, crept under my good grey cloak for the air was chill &amp; the vapours overhanging the fields &amp; woods made them look as if covered with hoarfrost. We have only a few nights this summer dispensed with a blanket, tonight we need one.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Tuesday [August] 20<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>A raw cloudy morning, settling into rain. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Curtis stopped just at our dinner time, I concluded he would join us sans ceremonie at our family meal as he had done before, &amp; spend the afternoon in hearing Debo play &amp; hurried preparations accordingly, but he came to bid goodbye, as he expects to take the Steamer next Sat<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-790-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-790">790</a></span></span> for Lubec, not to return this year from England! the old gentleman likes Russian society &amp; regrets leaving it. I quite forget to say that last week we were very early surprised by a visit from a M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Robertson,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-791-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-791">791</a></span></span> who as a graduate of West Point had claims upon Whistler tho he brought him no letters. he breakfasted with us. last Sat<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-792-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-792">792</a></span></span> he left for England to return to the U States.

Aunt A &amp; Sister &amp; Mary were presented with tickets, while Jemmie was writing a note to M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Hadenskoug on his birth day,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-794-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-794">794</a></span></span> poor fellow! I dare say he thinks of many a happy birth day under his own roof &amp; now he is dependent on us for kindness, Jemmie loves him sincerely &amp; gratefully I suppose his partiality to this Swede, makes him espouse his countrys cause &amp; admire the qualities of Charles 12<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> so greatly to the prejudice of Peter the G<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʈ</span>. he has been quite enthusiastic while reading the life of this king of Sweden this summer aloud to me. &amp; too willing to excuse his errors.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-795-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-795">795</a></span></span></p>

But for our meeting so many troops within the last few versts of Peterhoff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-797-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-797">797</a></span></span> we should have found the ride most agreable, passing so many noble estates &amp; palaces belonging to the Russian nobility,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-798-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-798">798</a></span></span> it is supposed 40.000 troops were on this road today at the breaking up of the camp. some ordered to Barracks in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P others going to Peterhoff. we left them at its gates<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-799-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-799">799</a></span></span> &amp; went immediately to the gardens, the imperial family being at the Palace<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-800-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-800">800</a></span></span> we could not see the inside of that, but it was pleasanter walking thro the extensive grounds, for they abound in beautiful objects &amp; the fountains are perhaps the finest in the world, whenever the Emperor is at Peterhoff they are playing, the source must be inexhaustible for the reservoir at the entrance is supplied from the gulf of Finland.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-801-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-801">801</a></span></span> I wish I could describe these gardens to convey some of the pleasure I enjoyed. The old Palace is situated rather elevated &amp; the water descends in sheets over steps, all the heathen deities preside,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-802-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-802">802</a></span></span> Jemmie was delighted with the figure of Sampson tearing open the jaws of the Lion from which ascended a jet stream 100 feet high<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-803-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-803">803</a></span></span> he was diverted at the <span class="CharOverride-1">fencing</span> of some of the gilded figures with water,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-804-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-804">804</a></span></span> indeed which ever way we strolled we saw novelties the bath house painted within &amp; without in the most fanciful yet chaste manner, its fountain in the centre, ropes covered with scarlet cloth all around it, the descent to the water by an inclined plain, sofas in the rooms at the end of the house for taking siestas after bathing, preparations were making for some of the ladies of the Court to bathe, a footman came with sheets &amp; towels, we took the hint &amp; retired.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-805-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-805">805</a></span></span> I was most charmed by the Summer house<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-806-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-806">806</a></span></span> as it is called down on the border of the Gulf, it is encircled at the back by a most beautiful flower garden, &amp; the view of the extensive sheet of water is enchanting, perhaps Peter here watched his fleet in its infancy, he built this retreat for himself, but after his death his daughters indulged their taste by adding many magnificent suites of apartments, he only had <span class="CharOverride-1">use</span> for a few, his kitchen where he is said to have cooked all his own meals adjoining the room where he slept which looks out upon the gulf. there are some fine pictures,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-807-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-807">807</a></span></span> but Peters own paintings of the feathered race<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-808-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-808">808</a></span></span> ought to be most highly prized tho our Jemmie was so saucy as to laugh at them.

No letters yesterday as we had hoped from Boston, but on our return from Peterhoff Mary handed us two, which M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes himself had brought, one proved from Emma Maingay<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-812-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-812">812</a></span></span> the other from M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell to my husband, he was at Hamburg,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-813-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-813">813</a></span></span> so well &amp; in such good spirits I think he would not disapprove of our opening his favor as it contributed to our cheerfulness.

For my own part it is a cause of regret to me whenever I hear foolish words set to music, it ought always to elevate the feelings &amp; no matter how melodious the air, I cannot enjoy what seems in direct opposition to the warning of our Saviour upon “idle words”.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-816-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-816">816</a></span></span> My darling wish is, that if my dear James &amp; Willie acquire any proficiency in music, they may contribute to the praise of God in public worship.</p>

The church was filled in consequence, many were there who had not been the whole summer before! indeed he has so faithfully pointed out the sin of lukewarmness, that by degrees we have observed the number of his hearers increasing. He took his text from 2<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ơ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>Corinthians 3<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƨ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>chap 9<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>verse,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-825-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-825">825</a></span></span> and introducing his subject by exalting the profession of a minister of the gospel, he most solemnly dwelt upon his duties as a clergyman of the Church &amp; as if standing before the judgement seat of Christ asked the awful question had he been faithful to his charge? his own voice faltered often, &amp; not many eyes were dry, his quotations from scripture were as they always are most forcible, the bible is his foundation always, therefore who can oppose the truths he advances. there were also an unusual number of communicants. I spoke to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Law after service she was in deep mourning. she told me the death of her husbands mother<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-826-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-826">826</a></span></span> had put an end to his travels thro G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Britian &amp; that we must expect him immediately to return to S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Peters As we drove home Miss F — thanked me over &amp; oft for taking her to church, she said she never heard such a sermon in her life, it had not been her will to stay from the house of God all Summer! how sorry I felt that she had to meet a dinner party in the afternoon thus to commemorate the 4<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>birth day of the <span class="CharOverride-1">only child spared </span>her cousin,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-827-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-827">827</a></span></span> was not to deserve the blessing.

And now that I have noticed the Lords day which has become my holiday from earthly cares, I will touch upon the pleasant afternoon we have had today (I forgot to note last friday, I drove to the city with my Sister to pay some calls, &amp; at M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Woods was invited to take my family to meet hers at the gardens of Katrineoff<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-829-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-829">829</a></span></span> today. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gellibrands party also went, and our pastor M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams soon joined us there, the sun shone upon us, as we sauntered about the pretty grounds admiring the serpentine streams flower beds &amp; green grass (for the incessant rains have kept even this favorite resort so near the city quite verdant) We went into the old palace said to have been built by Peter the G<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span>, himself<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-830-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-830">830</a></span></span> and certainly examined many of his attempts at the arts &amp; sciences<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-831-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-831">831</a></span></span> within it, some very old &amp; beautiful embroidery<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-832-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-832">832</a></span></span> we admired, but most of all its curiosities a chinese cabinet of ivory inlaid.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-833-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-833">833</a></span></span> the hangings<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-834-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-834">834</a></span></span> thro out the apartments are of Peters time his spirit of economy might be a lesson, as it forms a striking contrast to the profusion of the present time. On our return to the Summer house where M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Wood rents a parlour<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-835-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-835">835</a></span></span> (that she may afford her children the range of these convenient grounds every afternoon) we found a large table set covered with sweet meats, fruits, home made bread &amp; butter, tea &amp; coffee, I had time for a nice chat with our hostess &amp; friends before we assembled at the plentiful board, &amp; was allowed to depart with my little boys &amp; Aunt Alicia immediately after. Debo remained under M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Gellibrands wing, &amp; on her reaching home made me congratulate myself upon having avoided a disquisition upon the Athanasian Creed<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-836-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-836">836</a></span></span> &amp; also some stern remarks upon M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> Moleneux<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-837-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-837">837</a></span></span> view of the Lental fast &amp; Regeneration.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-838-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-838">838</a></span></span> I always feel that our blessed Saviour precepts are so plain that he who runneth may read &amp; that if we walk humbly as to our own merits, looking to Him as the author &amp; finisher of our salvation “fulfilling all righteousness”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-839-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-839">839</a></span></span> we may be saved without diving into mysteries, and these questions are so seldom without bitterness that I dread them. I certainly have enjoyed much christian fellowship with the Gellibrands, tho they are not of our church, &amp; I have also felt refreshed &amp; edified in listening to the gospel as preached by M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Williams these three months past. In heaven all these walls will be broken down, we shall be one in Christ Jesus — </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Tuesday [August] 27<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-840-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-840">840</a></span></span> I have counted the days lately &amp; in communings with my own spirit have thought of this day twelve months ago when we had our dear George with us on board the Acadia &amp; I so fondly listened to my darling Charlie as he would answer to all who asked him of his birth day — “Charlie is two years old today.” And do I weep selfishly this anniversary that he is not still at my side? Oh no! I have learned to be quite reconciled to my loss, not that <span class="CharOverride-1">time</span> has rendered the impression of my anguish at closing that dear babys<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-841-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-841">841</a></span></span> in death less acute, but <span class="CharOverride-1">faith</span> thro which I see him rejoicing in his Saviours love comforts me. there is a chord in a mothers heart of such exquisitive tenderness which as it vibrates to memory awakening is so of mingled pleasure &amp; pain, of fondness &amp; sorrow that none but a mother who has outlived a darling child can understand it. Sometimes it seems a burning spot of intense love in my heart. But as my Heavenly Father called home <span class="CharOverride-1">both</span> my darlings on His own holy day of rest, every sabbath becomes to me an anniversary of their new birth. Thus also has the first day of every year become a consecrated day to me, when our Heavenly Parent took back one He had lent us for fifteen years even our bright &amp; darling Joe. Praise be to Him for calling our affections from this world of toil &amp; anxiety to rest with Him upon the many anniversaries of affliction which have thus been rendered good for us. My only wish is that all left us may so pass the time of their sojourning here that they may be faithful unto the end for Christ, labouring for Him <span class="CharOverride-1">in</span> the world, not of the world.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Wed [August] 28<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span><span class="CharOverride-2" lang="ar-SA"><span id="endnote-842-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-842">842</a></span></span> When Debo proposed to me yesterday that we should avail of an invitation from Col Todd to pass the day at Tsarskoe Selo as when Whistler is here we cannot use the horses without interfering with his daily visits to town, I determined to yeild to her wishes that we might gratify Aunt Alicia with a sight of the Parks about the Palace in all their verdure, so we ordered the Calashe notwithstanding Coachers dread that 21 versts would be too much for our ponies. Willie took his seat at his side on the box &amp; his prattle in Russ always charms poor Péotre. After turning out of the cross road into the turnpike we found ourselves in a beautiful avenue of Linden trees with noble mile stones<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-843-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-843">843</a></span></span> like monuments, on this route we passed some of the neatest villages I have seen in this country, the gable end of the log cottages facing the road is generally carved &amp; painted,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-844-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-844">844</a></span></span> &amp; on either side the turnpike (which must be the original Imperial road to Tsarskoe before the railroad was built, indeed still preferred by the Empress) there is also a private country road along by the villages so that the avenue is very broad, we observed the peasants all in their holiday suits &amp; many hurrying to church (for there are gorgeous Greek churches at suitable points of access wherever we drive) It was the Anniversary of the <span class="CharOverride-1">Virgin Marys death</span>!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-845-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-845">845</a></span></span> I wonder what chronicler informs them — even all the children seemed to have at least a new shirt or frock, and we could see into the cottages young maidens braiding each others hair &amp; tying the large bow of ribbons at the end of the braid which hangs down the back &amp; of which the [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] look so proud. I wish I could draw a sketch of the classic stone fountain<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-846-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-846">846</a></span></span> we passed just as we were turning out of this avenue to wind upwards into another leading into Tsarskoe, nothing in this country which the Emperor is likely to come in sight of can be built without his approving the style, so we find even the stone wells on these public roads are classic. On arriving at the Cols it was only 12 oclock, his reception was flatteringly cordial, his carriage had been waiting upon us some hours, so we soon stepped into it &amp; drove thro the beautiful grounds belonging to the New Palace,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-847-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-847">847</a></span></span> within which is the Armoury,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-848-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-848">848</a></span></span> there we alighted, the first object which rivetted my attention was a little visiter standing on the porch a beautiful black eyed boy! Willie said as I stooped to kiss the stranger “he looks like Andrea doesn’t he Mother?” and so said Aunt Alicia, but my heart whispered Oh so much more as my own Kirkie used to! and James discovered that the resemblance was to that “bright eyed” brother, so much more refined in beauty than Andrea. I could have lingered long beside him, but who ever he been [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] brought there by called him off, as did the Col us at the same instant. My boys will not forget the suits of Armor in such variety of different countries, but especially those two which had been worn by the Emperor Nicholas &amp; his eldest son the Grand Duke Alexander,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-849-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-849">849</a></span></span> also the immense gun which it is the Emperors pride to handle so dexterously in going thro the exercises.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-850-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-850">850</a></span></span> We saw some noble horses the veritable skins stuffed to appear like life,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-851-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-851">851</a></span></span> one which had belonged to Tipoo Saib with a figure wearing his own armor placed upon his saddle.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-852-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-852">852</a></span></span> An old helmet taken from Herculaneum<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-853-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-853">853</a></span></span> excited some wonder tho not for its beauty, and the massive lock upon one of the doors was pointed out by our guide as a great curiosity, known to be at least two thousand years old &amp; taken from Jerusalem it is a ponderous but by no means rough specimen of mechanism.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-854-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-854">854</a></span></span> Debo long gazed thro her glass &amp; admired the accoutrements for an equestrian covered with diamonds presented to the present Emperor, those from Mahmoud in 1833 most gorgeous, but the other said to be the gift of the Pascha of Persia the saddle cloth lilac showered over with diamonds looked most brilliant, scabbard, stirrups, girths &amp;c of each glittering with these priceless stones.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-855-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-855">855</a></span></span> I should be laughed at in the Court of earthly Princes if I expressed a wish that the value of these might be transferred to the Missionary fund, instead of being shut up in glass cases to excite envy &amp; amazement. My little Jemmie [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] heart was sad as in examining other glass cases, he discovered swords which had been taken in the battles between Czar Peter &amp; Charles 12<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> he knew from their rich hilts set in pearls &amp; precious stones they must have belonged to noble Swedes.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-856-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-856">856</a></span></span> Oh! he exclaimed I’d rather have one of these than all the other things in this armory, how beautiful they are!” The noble circular hall in the centre of the building which was formerly a palace, used in Alexanders time to be used as a banquetting hall, it is lighted from the roof,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-857-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-857">857</a></span></span> we saw what used to be the sleeping apartment of the Empress of this late Emperor, for this was her favorite abode,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-858-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-858">858</a></span></span> probably because too small for state, as we find the Imperial family now prefer their new Palace from this reason that they can live retired in it. We were told we could not enter that, as the room the favorite Grand duchess so lately occupied is being fitted up as an Oratory,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-859-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-859">859</a></span></span> an especial service is to be performed in it on the return of the Court to Tsarskoe Selo,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-860-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-860">860</a></span></span> probably prayers offered up for her soul? Ah when will the time arrive when all these errors will be done away with in the Greek Church “There is no repentence in the grave”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-861-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-861">861</a></span></span> thro Eternity the soul must be as it leaves this world of trial! We did not propose gaining admittance into the Catherine Palace as we had been thro it with the Col on our former visit, &amp; that also was undergoing a thorough refreshing for the Grand Duke Alexanders family soon to return to.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-862-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-862">862</a></span></span> We had enough in the extensive grounds to interest my Sister, the serpentine streams, lakes (with snowy swans) &amp; fountains, the water brought from a great distance,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-863-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-863">863</a></span></span> the Chinese bridge with Chinese men &amp; women keeping it<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-864-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-864">864</a></span></span> delighted our boys most, but they were willing to be driven home with the Col &amp; Aunt A for a luncheon at 2 oclock, while Debo &amp; I went to call on a friend of M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ʀ</span> Maingays<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-865-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-865">865</a></span></span> We were told the governess Miss M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span> Lean<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-866-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-866">866</a></span></span> was in, she was delighted to see Debo &amp; I was as much delighted with her, Among the many agreable ladies I have become acquainted with here, I have given the palm to three English governesses<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-867-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-867">867</a></span></span> for elegance, affability &amp; intellectual adornments, this young lady so gentle &amp; refined, is the bosom friend of Eliza Maingay, her politeness must spring from piety then or Eliza would not select her, in conversation with her time slipped away, until as we were rising to go Madame O Lainy<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-868-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-868">868</a></span></span> carriage was heard, just as we were moving to go, with regret at not seeing her she arrived, &amp; Oh how pleased I felt we had not missed her, she is quite an invalid for all the sashes were closed ere she dared enter into the drawing room, she is about my own age, has one young daughter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-869-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-869">869</a></span></span> to whom Miss M<span class="CharOverride-9">c</span> L is governess.

I was somewhat annoyed that he had deemed it necessary to entertain us to have a dinner party in preparation for us, two gents had fortunately been engaged but three met us at five oclock. One was a Russian Gen<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ɲ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>who spoke English,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-874-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-874">874</a></span></span> tho he did not avail himself of it to say much to any one. Madame O Lainys nephew<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-875-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-875">875</a></span></span> also spoke our language &amp; made himself very agreable, but the Capt of the Chevalier Guards<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-876-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-876">876</a></span></span> who sat next Debo tho he spoke only french was the greatest acquisition to the party, he had so much vivacity &amp; politeness, the Col also felt himself bound to address him in the Court language! it was to me really ridiculous that he would interpret every speech he made, to me. I at last told him that I understood french tho I wanted confidence in attempting to speak The Col proposed in french drinking the Emperors health in champagne, which not even the Russian Gen<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ɲ</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>who declined wine, could refuse &amp; even I put my glass to my lips tho I, invariably refuse, for I did not know if it might not be misconstrued into disrespect &amp; for Whistlers sake I went thro the motions, this encouraged my little boys &amp; they presented their glasses to be filled, and forgetting at their little side table the guests at ours, Willie in his glee called out aloud “Santé à l’Empereur” the Capt clapped his hands with delight &amp; afterwards addressed the little American in french, all at the table laughed &amp; called the boys “bon sujets.” I had wished to be at home by eight oclock, the Cols arrangements frustrated my intention &amp; when he urged that we would take a short drive of 20 minutes to Pavloski<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-877-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-877">877</a></span></span> that Debo might hear the bands of music I could not deny her the gratification, so we again took possession of his carriage after coffee &amp; he drove with one of the young Gents, the boys were told by the Chasseur (who always of course takes his place behind the Cols equipage) as we drove thro the town &amp; the soldiers doffed their caps to the carriage, that they were paying honors to him, to his green feather he ought to have said, but the truth is the Chasseur as readily as Miller<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-878-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-878">878</a></span></span> adopt all the consequence of our Ambassador himself &amp; are divertingly happy in their conceits, tho they do provoke Madmoiselle Whistler by their airs, I do not mind them as they are remarkably attentive to us. Our short drive was really enchanting Tsarskoe is certainly the neatest place I ever saw in my life, not a stone out of place, the head gardener of the Imperial Grounds has also the supervision of the whole town<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-879-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-879">879</a></span></span> it is related of him that one of the Imperial family once found fault with his want of neatness in the Parks. he was alarmed! not a leaf was allowed to remain on the nicely sanded walks! no but he had forgotten spittoons!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-880-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-880">880</a></span></span> But of our drive, it was shady just before entering the fairy scene at Pavloski<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-881-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-881">881</a></span></span> for the evergreens are of an enormous size, the rail road extends this far &amp; by the 7 oclock train from S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> Petersburg the garden becomes filled, green benches are placed in every direction Hermans band (a famous German band)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-882-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-882">882</a></span></span> plays alternately with a fine military band, Jemmie liked the latter best, Sister the former, as to little Willie he unconciously marched or danced as either measure was played, the Pavilion was being hung with variagated lamps, but we only were beguiled into lingering a half hour. Our own horses being quite refreshed, were ready for a start when we reached the Cols again. but Miller had tea ready &amp; we must accept the refreshment, tho I thought proper to decline the loaf of home made bread just from the oven which he knew was a greater treat than plum cake to those who are only “bakers clients”. We had a full moon to light us upon our road, the peasants were all assembled before their doors in groups this holiday evening singing their own peculiar glees, or dancing, I was so in hopes to find my gude mon at home, but was dissappointed.</p>

Neither Mother or Sisters had thought it worth while to fill the blank pages my brother had sent! In the midst of my sadness I was summoned to the parlor to entertain William Maingay, &amp; moreover we were engaged to tea at the Gellibrands. I can exert myself where others are depending upon my efforts, so I trust I was not deficient either in acts of kindness at home or at our neighbours, we had our own round table surrounded at home for the childrens, &amp; for M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ms refreshment first &amp; at eight oclock he attended us to the next estate, &amp; kept his poor horses &amp; Coachman waiting in the road until eleven that he might not be the first to leave the friendly circle.

M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Fairbanks returned in his carriage as he went, we soon had a cold cut ready with a fine musk melon out of the ice to refresh them.

I fear they rather annoyed M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M for they both crept on his knees to watch his countenance while he told his travels, how charming the recital! we each longed to follow his advice &amp; go the same route thro Prussia, Germany, France &amp;c. He afterwards opened a box &amp; presented me with some beautiful steel ornaments he had bought at Munich, he also gave the boys keep sakes &amp; stocked Whistler with cigars.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-904-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-904">904</a></span></span> Debo has had the youngest daughter of D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Law passing a week with her, Emily<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-905-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-905">905</a></span></span> &amp; herself had amused themselves during the morning in making riddles of the names of all their acquaintance in S<span class="CharOverride-9">t</span> P. they slily added M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwells to the list &amp; gave them out to be solved at the tea table, which occasioned some merriment. I have not observed my dear husband so cheerful for a great while he played accompaniments on the piano, ending with Irish airs on the bag pipes. I persuaded Debo to close her concert with some sacred music that our minds might be attuned to Gods word &amp; to prayer. I know not what our young friend felt at kneeling again at our family altar, but I hope he was grateful to God who had restored him in health to us after perils by sea. Yesterday when we assembled at breakfast I persuaded him not to go to town &amp; also told Emily Law we could not send her home in the rain. so Whistler went alone. The sun came out gloriously, after my dear boys reading to me they went fishing with M<span class="CharOverride-9"> </span>M, about noon the young ladies followed them, taking some currant bun for all to eat in the wood. About 2 hours after I heard James <span class="CharOverride-1">shouting</span> forth his excitement &amp; soon perceived a cart full Debo, &amp; Emily seated on a log inside the rough vehicle, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> M at the back &amp; our boys hitched on at the sides, James mirth had arisen from his “skoray”ing<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-906-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-906">906</a></span></span> the poor driver, &amp; Sister begging him to go slowly over the jolting road. Whistler by way of a treat came home to dinner at 4 oclock I had feared as neither butcher or fish monger came we should have short commons, but our good cook really worked a miracle out of two pair chickens, beef steaks, mushrooms, squashes &amp;c in the shapes of pies &amp; pasties so that, our board was bountifully furnished. The Gellibrands came to tea (all but Martha who was not well) and seemed as glad to talk with M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell as we are to listen to him. M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Ropes &amp; Debo played on harp &amp; piano Whistler accompanying them. our visiters were obliged to leave before their usual time as baby was so naughty as to send for Mama.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-907-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-907">907</a></span></span> After the rest of us dispersed to our several apartments Whistler sat some time talking with Maxwell who is soon to say farewell<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-908-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-908">908</a></span></span> — This morning he must return to town, so my sister &amp; self have been left to take care of the boys, as Debo went with Emily, to spend today with her. I have had a heavy heart since they left, in reflection of the past year, &amp; thinking of the future, prayer has comforted me &amp; I have found hope in Gods holy word.</p>

Our last evening in the country was spent at the kind Gellibrands, after my days hard work at packing up I felt it to be very refreshing, M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> G [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] had such a charming bright fire in her parlor grate to cheer us for the evenings begin to get chilly. Tuesday morning<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-911-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-911">911</a></span></span> after our 6 carts of goods &amp; chattels were underweigh &amp; our Calash waiting at the door I stepped in to bid good bye to my neighbours on each side, the Drurys are so kind I could scarce find words to express my thanks, at the last moment our good old landlord sent me in a basket of “vegetable marrow” string beans to salt for winters use &amp; a still more attractive basket of every variety of Dahlias, with another filled with grapes from his green house. Willie &amp; Tscharsinka embraced tenderly bidding adieu &amp; promising to visit each other in Russ. the weather was propitious, &amp; we accomplished much in unpacking all our things. M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Ropes insisted upon our dining at his house which is under the same roof with our own, we merely have to cross the head of our wide stair case from our front door to his,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-912-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-912">912</a></span></span> we each selected these lodgings for their healthy situation on the English Quai, the view &amp; the air of the Neva so fine, my dear husbands office is one of the snuggest of our rooms, we have just ten rooms including kitchens &amp; for servants, our rent half of that of the Bobrinsky dom, is yet extravegently high $ 900! tho our flat is the 3<span class="CharOverride-9">rd</span> story. And now we are in nice order I am sorry Whistler must leave us just when he could enjoy his home so much for he has laboured to procure us comforts. but the Count K goes to Moscow tomorrow<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-913-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-913">913</a></span></span> &amp; he leaves us for a fortnight. he was too busy in his office to write last friday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-914-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-914">914</a></span></span> as we did by the Courier, as we did [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>], however much I wished him to answer my brothers last few lines I know Whistlers letters number 3 to 1 of Macs<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-915-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-915">915</a></span></span> and that he would gladly write oftener if he could for his thoughts are continually turning to this friend of his youth. Our boys have been every fine day to see M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Maxwell which was a relief to me while I was in a bustle &amp; could not attend to them, he one day took them a drive to Alexandrofski &amp; dined them at the Hotel de Paris, another day he gave them a sail across the Neva &amp; sauntered about with them on some of the Islands. Willie especially loves this countryman of ours &amp; wishes <span class="CharOverride-1">I</span> would only go back to America when he does then Willie would not hesitate to accompany him home! last Saturday<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-916-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-916">916</a></span></span> he dined with us, as did M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> Joseph Ropes &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƣ</span> Geo Prince, As we were afterwards seated in the drawing room, Debo having regaled us with coffee &amp; music our boys spoke a french dialogue, Willie wished lights brought in to give effect, but there was applause enough without.

At family worship I felt near fainting &amp; could scarcely repeat the Lords prayer to be heard tho it has become more full of meaning since my little one’s fondness for it has so associated it with him. As I embraced my dear Debo (as is my custom on rising from prayers before breakfast every morning, my heart became relieved by weeping. I retired to my room again with my darling Willie &amp; Jemmie &amp; read with them until time for Mary to get them ready for going to church with their father, &amp; felt soothing as was the sympathy of all I was best alone to pour out my soul in supplication to my Saviour to make me thankful as I ought to be that He has taken that little one He lent me two whole years at a time when I needed comfort &amp; to beseech Him to forgive me if the renewal of my selfish grief should be in His sight sinful, I even felt grateful that my heart was soft enough still to weep over the remembrance of my trial of last year! but I ought rather to be grateful that I do not sorrow as those without hope!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-921-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-921">921</a></span></span> Oh the extacy of the prospect of our all being united around the throne of the Lamb!

I pray God may reward her seven fold, she certainly does her duty in the state of life to which He has called her, is so patient &amp; forbearing, so industrious &amp; modest I trust in His sight her motive is for the praise of God. “Aunt Alicia” and I talked with our boys after they went to bed of those who were of as bright promise as themselves who have “gone before” them into a home prepared for them since the foundation of the world. even of our sainted boys Joe &amp; Henry, and of Sweet Louly<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-926-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-926">926</a></span></span> too.

			<p class="Endnote-text2">He was named for Kirk Boott (Boston, MA 20 October 1790– Lowell, MA 3 April 1837), the founder of Lowell, Massachusetts. Kirk Boott was born in Boston and was sent back to England to Rugby for his education. He saw a great deal of his relatives in Derby, his father’s birthplace, during his boyhood and youth. He returned to the United States and entered Harvard, from which he does not appear to have graduated. He later joined the British Army and served during the Peninsular War in Spain and Portugal with the Duke of Wellington; he “received a commission and commanded a detachment at the siege of San Sebastian in July 1813.” His regiment was ordered to America when the United States entered the war against England, but Boott was granted leave of absence because he refused to fight against the country of his birth. “He retained his commission until peace was declared after Waterloo.” On 14 November 1818, he married Anne Haden, second daughter of Thomas Haden, a Derby physician, returning shortly thereafter to Boston. He had become interested in cotton manufacturing and had acquired knowledge of the new textile industry while in Derby. He now sought to develop it in Massachusetts. With the backing of some Boston financiers, he set out in 1822 to “search for water power to work the mills and bleacheries,” which led him to choose the Merrimack River. He wanted to give the new town established here the name of Derby, but his backers chose instead to name it for Francis Cabot Lowell, who had introduced cotton manufacturing into the United States. Boott represented the town in the state legislature. He also founded Lowell’s first church, which bore the name of St. Anne, in honour of his wife, and resembled architecturally St. Michael’s Church in Derby, where he had married Anne Haden. He died of apoplexy in 1837, survived by his widow and six children.</p>

Between c. 79 and 400 AD, as the name implies, it was the site of a Roman fort. There is not “much written evidence about Ribchester” “until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,” at which time it was considered poor in comparison to its past history. “Before the second half of the eighteenth century,” it was a small village “with no more than a few hundred inhabitants.” In the seventeenth century, “the poorer sort of people” lived “by spinning and weaving linen clothes,” but “cotton manufacturing replaced that of linen” in the eighteenth century. By the late eighteenth century, the increase in the number of handloom weavers led to the building of many new cottages. Ribchester began at this time “to take on something like its present appearance.” For some fifty years after 1780, “handloom weaving and certain related trades like bobbin turning reigned supreme in Ribchester.” However, by the 1840s, when Anna Whistler visited Ribchester with James and Willie, hard economic times had come for the weavers because of “the advent of efficient power looms.” The population of the village declined steadily in subsequent decades as young people moved to towns to find work (A.C. Hodge and J.F. Ridge, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ribchester: A Short History and Guide, </span>2nd ed. (Preston, UK: Carnegie Press, 1986), pp. 4, 8, 9, 11).</span></p>

It was described in 1828 as follows:</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">The edifice is plain but elegant, and very neat and commodious within. It is 97 feet in length, and 43 in breadth, with 18 windows on each side; and has a portico of several columns, and a small belfry, after the shape of those in our [English] country churches. The altar, which is in a recess, in the form of a semicircle, with six columns, is covered with blue velvet and gold fringe. On one side of this stands the pulpit, and on the other the reading-desk; but these are too large, and out of proportion to the place itself … This building is said to have cost 15,000 l.; part of which was defrayed by … the English-Russian company, and part by a duty imposed on English vessels here. The minister has an income of 7000 rubles, with a house, etc. besides the emoluments derived from surplice fees. (William Rae Wilson, <span class="CharOverride-1">Travels in Russia</span>, 2 vols.

			<p class="Endnote-text2">The resident English population of the city was about 100. During navigation, about 700 English and 50 American vessels entered the port. Their crews averaged ten men to a ship. The average number of communicants was 40 to 50. </p>

[London: John Murray, 1865]; <span class="CharOverride-1">The Illustrated London News</span>, December 29, 1866). The church accommodated about 200 people. Support of the Church and appointment of the minister rested with the Russia Company. The Church had no resident poor and few casual calls upon its charity, so that communion alms were mostly distributed among the Russian poor (G.E. Biber, ed., <span class="CharOverride-1">The English Church on the Continent; or, An Account of the Foreign Settlements of the English Church: Including a Notice of the Times of Service, and Other Information Useful to Travellers and Foreign Residents</span> [London: Francis &amp; John Rivington, 1845], p. 73). </p>

Its construction in 1829–1832 was made necessary by the development of the port of Petersburg in the first half of the 19th century, when customs facilities could no longer fit into the old houses adapted for them on the bank of the Little Neva. In its silhouette, the Customs House – designed in the forms of Russian late Classicism – matches the Kunstkamera, which is located symmetrically with respect to the axis of the ensemble of the spit of Vasilievskii Island. Rectangular in plan, the main façade of the Customs House faces the Little Neva and is crowned by a sloping cupola on a tall drum.

Every attention was rendered by the passengers and the Captain, but there was not a bit of medicine on board and in spite of all they could do, without this, the child died with convulsions.

It was located in the First Admiralty District, Fourth Ward. The mansion occupied the territory where two houses had stood, one of which was rebuilt in the 1790s by a Swiss architect in Russian service since 1783, Luigi Ruska (1758–1822), in the style characteristic for an estate in the city at the end of the 18th century. In 1797, both houses had become the property of Bobrinskii’s father, Count Aleksei Grigorievich Bobrinskii (see <a href="images_5.html#image87" target="_blank">Image 87</a>), son of Catherine the Great and Count Grigorii Grigorievich Orlov (see <a href="images_15.html#image414" target="_blank">Images 414</a>, <a href="images_15.html#image443" target="_blank">443</a>). The architectural treatment of the façades of the central mass of the house was more elaborate than that of the other structures. The middle section of the main façade was distinguished by an Ionic portico, which emphasized the projecting mass that contained the staircase. The portico was decorated with allegorical sculpture. The garden façade of the house was broken up by semicircular projecting bays, or pavilions, and a portico with four Corinthian columns and a pediment. In 1822–1825, the inside of the mansion was remodeled and an enfilade of reception rooms was created on the garden side. The main staircase was decorated in an extremely severe and simple manner. A round opening was made in the covering above the staircase, and through it could then be seen the walls decorated with a cornice with modillions, the light metal railing of the circular gallery of the upper floor, and the painted decorations of the cupola. Among the rooms of the house were a ballroom, the Red living room, the White Salon, and the Blue Salon. The Blue Salon had been included in Major Whistler’s apartment, in which Maxwell now lived (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Sept. 30, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 22). The outstanding painted decor of the White Salon and ballroom is thought to be the work of Giovanni-Battista Scotti (1777–1830). Other rooms in the house contained similar decoration (<span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury Leningrada</span> 1958, pp. 228–229; <span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury Leningrada</span> 1975, p. 284; Levina and Kirpideli, <span class="CharOverride-1">Po ètim ulitsam</span>, pp. 138–142).

			<p class="Endnote-text2">M.A. Korf commented, when Charles Baird died, that he was remarkable, having built the first steamboat – of twenty horsepower – in Russia in 1816 and received in 1817 sole rights to the steamboat business for a ten-year period. In 1815, when it is usually said he built the first steamboat, he placed a wood-burning machine of four horsepower on “a simple Tikhvin boat” and, after several tests on the Neva River, set out in this boat on 3 November (OS) for Cronstadt. An unprecedented guest, he was met by the entire naval administration of the port and, towards evening, returned without incident to the Baird dock in St. Petersburg. About one thousand people were employed by Baird’s foundry, which could pour up to two thousand poods (a pood is thirty-six pounds) of iron and up to twelve hundred poods of bronze per day. All workers, both moulders (<span class="CharOverride-1">liteishchiki</span>) and chasers (<span class="CharOverride-1">chekanshchiki</span>), were Russians. Francis inherited ten steamboats from his father, with an eleventh in the process of being built (M.A. Korf, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dnevnik God 1843-i</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Diary for 1843</span>], in <span class="CharOverride-1">Vremena i nravy: memuary, pis´ma, dnevniki</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Times and Mores: Memoirs, Letters, Diaries</span>], ed.

			<p class="Endnote-text2">“Tikhvin boats” were so-called because they were originally made in Tikhvin, for use on the River Tikhvinka, about 150 miles east of St. Petersburg. The barque-style boats were in general no more than 75 feet long and 20 feet wide. The design of the boat included a central iron stove pipe that could serve as a mast in fair winds. (E.P.

			<p class="Endnote-text2">The firing of the stove was well explained and its virtues extolled by Maxwell: “All the houses are warmed by the <span class="CharOverride-1">peitch</span> which is a species of oven in which is placed several pieces of wood cut about the size of that which you were used to burn in your room. This wood is fired and the chimney is left open for the smoke to escape until the wood upon the floor of the oven is one mass of red hot coals. Then the Mugik [peasant] shuts down or closes the chimney and with his poker scatters within the oven the live coals. From these the oven soon becomes very warm and throws off a very pleasant heat, free from gaseous compounds and very agreeable to the feelings. If the thermometer indicates too much heat you have only to open the little door made in your double window and you soon have the right temperature” (John S. Maxwell to [his uncle] Dr. John B.

The house, which then served as the American Legation, had been rented by Colonel Charles Stewart Todd, who was living in it when they arrived in St. Petersburg and rented accommodations to them (John S Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Oct. 8/20, 1842, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 3). When Colonel Todd, who had been hearing rumors that he was to be recalled, found it financially expedient to give up the house, Major Whistler took the entire house for his family (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, September 9, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 21). Maxwell, too, was making preparations to move and had already decided where he would live “when Major W. took the house and offered me the rooms he occupied last winter at the same rent I was going to pay elsewhere, with the privilege of leaving them at any time I choose. I of course was glad to accept his offer, upon his stating that he did not want the rooms and would not let them to any one but me” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Sept. 9, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 21). The freedom to give up his lodgings whenever he might choose, instead of paying three months in advance elsewhere, appealed to Maxwell, who expected his own recall to follow Todd’s. But they were not recalled, and Maxwell, comparing his lodgings to those of his colleagues of the same rank in the diplomatic corps, felt he had “far better rooms for comfort and for show than any” of them (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Oct. 20, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 23).</span></p>

In the house in which I expected at first to hire apartments. the fuel or heat was a fixture, and formed part of the rent, which is the same I pay here except that I provide my own fire. I can do this for $50 for the winter and it is worth 50 dollars to be in a house where you live with one family you know … You enter from the Porters Hall into a large room in blue. which I will call the Anti-chamber. It contains a large looking glass, three sofa’s, a number of chairs, and has three curtained windows looking into the street and a highly polished oak floor. In this room there are two doors, one leading into an apology for a buffet, thence into my little bed room, and thence again into my dressing room. Out of the buffet or pantry a door opens leading to the court yard etc. The other door in the blue room leads into my parlour where I am now writing this. The walls are ornamented with a kind of woollen paper representing large red grape vines in a very flourishing state. Around the edge of the ceiling there run’s a gilt or brass band about two inches in breadth, and a chandelier of golden look hangs from the middle of the same. The two windows upon the street are hung with white figured curtain’s which look very well when newly washed, and in opposite corners fastened into the two peitchs for heating the rooms are mirrors of large dimension. The furniture is all of mahogany and the curtains the chairs and sofa of red figured velvet as soft as down can make them. There are four tables, a fire screen, three good <span class="CharOverride-S">views</span> paintings representing charming views in the Crimea etc etc all belonging to Count Boberinsky our landlord excepting a picture of Peter the Great hanging over my head which belongs to Major Whistler. A grate has been inserted in one of the peitches, and a good Liverpool coal fire now blazes away diffusing quite a radience on all within its radeii which is again reflected from the bright surface of the newly waxed and varnished oak beneath my feet. If I can keep out the dust and dirt, if the heat dont melt off the legs of the tables and chairs, if bugs dont breed in the cushions and sofas I think I shall be snug for the winter. (John S.

Finally, on quarter-day he “concluded to give up the house … having no news of a decided character by the last steamer, by which he could regulate his future movements” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Sept. 9, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 21). He set out for Stockholm, intending to be absent three weeks, and to take up lodgings on his return at “M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Benson’s a boarding house on the key where he has engaged a suite of rooms” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Sept. 9, 1843). The boarding house of the misses Elizabeth and Sarah Benson was located on the English Embankment in the house of Rall, numbered variously as No. 39 and No. 240– 241 (RGIA: Fond 1689, op. 1, d. 13. <span class="CharOverride-1">British Residents and British Congregation St. Petersburg 1845 </span>[hereafter, <span class="CharOverride-1">BRBC STP 1845</span>], fol. 5). Maxwell’s reaction to Todd’s choice was that he would “be comfortable, pay dear and loose [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] caste” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Sept. 30, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 22), for “according to the notions that prevail here and the established etiquette he might as well live in a stable” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Oct. 20, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 23).

			<p class="Endnote-text4">When Major Whistler sent for his family, Maxwell accompanied him to look for a suitable house for them: “Rents here are enormous, particularly for furnished houses. and it is almost impossible to get a house to one’s self as they are all so large. Many families live together, each occupying a floor, and in one house here there are 4000 inmates.

The sixth Winter Palace, it was built in 1754– 1764 by Francesco-Bartolomeo Rastrelli (1700– 1771). It stands on the site of the razed fourth Winter Palace that he had started to build with his father, Carl Bartolomeo, in 1732. As had the fourth palace, it faces onto the Palace Embankment and Palace Square. It is in the shape of an irregular square around a courtyard, and is four stories high. The main façade of the Winter Palace, which faces onto Palace Square, has gates in the middle consisting of three entries that lead into the main courtyard. To the sides of these gates are porticos with lanterns: the one on the left is the portico of the Heir Apparent, on the right that of the Commandant (Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, p. 241; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, pp. 240–242). </span></p>

Between the front of the Winter Palace and the semi-circle of the Main Staff Headquarters building opposite it is a vast area called Palace Square, sometimes called Alexander Square because of the Alexander column in the center of it (see <a href="images_6.html#image116" target="_blank">Images 116</a>, <a href="images_6.html#image132" target="_blank">132</a>). Palace Square may be entered from the Nevskii Prospekt by passing along a short section of street called Malaia Millionnaia, which is irregularly perpendicular to the Nevskii Prospekt, and then through the arch in the building of the Main Staff Headquarters (Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 43, 178– 179, 341).

On the Palace Embankment side of the Winter Palace is located the main, or Ambassadors’, staircase (also called the Jordan staircase; see <a href="images_6.html#image115" target="_blank">Image 115</a>), which leads along a magnificent portico into the main salons of the Winter Palace (Grech<span class="CharOverride-1">,</span> p. 241). This is where Colonel Todd and the Whistlers entered the Winter Palace. It is called the Ambassadors’ Staircase because foreign ambassadors ascended it to present their credentials; it is called the Jordan Staircase because on 6 January (OS) the reigning emperor descended it to attend the ceremony of the Blessing of the Waters in memory of the baptism of Christ in the Jordan River (George Heard Hamilton, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Art and Architecture of Russia</span> [Baltimore, MD: Penguin, [1954], p. 182).</span></p>

The most outstanding improvements to the building were made in the reign of Alexander I (see <a href="images_15.html#image418" target="_blank">Image 418</a>), according to the plans of Academician Andreian Zakharov (1761–1811). The entire length of its façade, from the side where the Nevskii and other two prospects fan out, extends for 200 sazhens. (A sazhen equals 7 ft, or 2.13 m.) The building has three projections: the center projection extends out 10 sazhens and the two side projections 17 sazhens. In the center of the first projection, there is an arch, which constitutes the main gates. The gates are decorated with bas reliefs by Terebenev (1780–1850) and with statues of sea nymphs supporting the heavenly sphere and the figures of Achilles, Ajax, Pirrhus, and Alexander of Macedon. Above the arch is a tower with twenty-eight Ionic columns that form a kind of gallery. Above the cornice are twenty-eight statues representing, among other things, the seasons, the elements, and the countries of the world. The tower rises from the cornice in a round column and ends in a cupola with clocks on three sides. Above that is a lantern surrounded by a gallery with light iron railings. From here, the gilded iron spire begins, at the top of which is a ship 10 feet tall. Under the ship can be seen a crown and an apple, the latter having a diameter of three and a half feet. The height of the spire from the ground is 33 sazhens. On both sides of the central projection the building extends for 37 sazhens and is decorated with military fittings instead of bas reliefs. From here start small projections, of which the first have six columns, while the second have twelve columns, all eighteen Doric. The superb façades, enriched with bas reliefs by Terebenev, give both these projections a magnificent appearance. The roof is decorated with statues by Anisimov. The façades of the sides of the Admiralty that face the Winter Palace and the Senate perfectly match those buildings and are 50 sazhens long. On the Neva side, there are two pavilions; one covers the end of the side façade of the Admiralty and serves as the boundary of the two parallel lines of this building.

He was “admired, even venerated,” on the one hand, and seen “as the personification of oppression,” on the other (Lincoln, p. 9). Because there are so few historical works on him, it is from the “biased, often bitter” “autobiographical and memoir accounts” of men “who suffered the ravages of censorship during his reign” that we have received “an untempered portait of a cruel, perhaps even mentally unbalanced tyrant” (Lincoln, p. 9) Lincoln recalls as a contrast the nostalgic words of Baroness Frederiks that “during the lifetime of Nikolai Pavlovich, Russia had great and noble stature … [and] he heaped still greater glory upon her” (quoted in Lincoln, p. 10).

The Winter Palace the Whistlers were viewing was a restored edifice. It had burned down in December 1837, and what the public viewed had been restored to its original appearance. The restoration was carried out with astonishing speed under the supervision of Count Pyotr Andreevich Kleinmikhel’ (see <a href="images_9.html#image243" target="_blank">Image 243</a>), head of the Main Administration of Transport and Public Buildings and Major Whistler’s superior, and was completed around Easter of 1839.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">The New Hermitage (see <a href="images_6.html#image113" target="_blank">Image 113</a>) was being built for exhibiting the Imperial collections because the Hermitage was crowded and could not be expanded, as well as because it was the living quarters of the Imperial family. Leo von Klenze (1784–1864), who had been the architect of the Old Pinakothek and the Glyptothek in Munich, was invited to design it. The two persons responsible for supervising the work were the minister of the Imperial Court, Prince P.M. Volkonskii, and the head of Transport and Public Buildings, Count P.A. Kleinmikhel’ (see <a href="images_9.html#image243" target="_blank">Image 243</a>). The latter had been responsible for rebuilding the Hermitage after the fire of 1837. Construction of the New Hermitage was begun in 1840 and completed in 1852 (V.A.

In 1843, they moved back to St. Petersburg on 9/21 November (Korf, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dnevnik 1843</span>, p. 344).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-110"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-110-backlink">110</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the town was Tsarskoe Selo (pronounced “Tsar&#8242;skuhyuh Sillaw&#8242;”; see <a href="images_14.html#image383" target="_blank">Images 383–394</a>). The simple explanation of the name is that it began as the Finnish “Saari mois” (“high place,” “elevated land”), which in Russian became “Sarskoe Selo” (“Saari Village”) and later “Tsarskoe Selo” (“The Tsar’s Village,” “The Imperial Village”) (Hamilton, <span class="CharOverride-1">Art and Architecture of Russia</span>, p. 283; William Craft Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">A History of Russian Architecture</span> [Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1993], p. 221, to name but two sources). S.N. Vil’chkovskii, the author of a guide prepared for the two-hundredth anniversary (1910) of Tsarskoe Selo, offers a plausible fuller explanation for the name of this ancient settlement, which passed from Russian into Swedish hands and during Peter the Great’s war with Charles XII of Sweden was returned to Russia. The Swedish feudal lord, on receiving the ancient Russian ancestral lands of Saritsa as a fief, naturally changed its name to Saritsgof, because the suffix “gof” meant there was a landlord’s house in the given settlement. Such settlements with a noble owner living in them were in Russian usage of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries referred to in this locale as a “myza” (grange, farmstead), probably because the local Finnish population called them “mois,” which means “myza.” Thus, the noble Saritsgof became in the speech of the Finnish settlers Saarimois, while it passed into Russian speech as Saritskaia and Sarskaia myza. The name Sarskaia myza changed in the time of Empress Elizaveta Petrovna to Sarskoe Selo because there had by then arisen around the former “myza” an entire settlement with a church attended by all the peasants from the surrounding Russian villages. Gradually the word “selo” began to replace “myza” in official documents as well. In the reign of Catherine the Great, everyone said and wrote “Tsarskoe Selo,” but “Sarskoe” appeared in some official documents up to 1808 (S.N. Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, reproduction of the 1911 edition [St. Petersburg: Title Publishing House, 1992], p. 12). However, Pushkarev said in 1842 that the place continued to be called “Sarskaia” up to the present time, while “Tsarskoe” was the name used in all official documents as of 1725 (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburga</span> 1842, p. 48). As we see from their correspondence, Colonel Todd and Maxwell wrote “Sarscacello” even in the 1840s. </span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">In addition to “Sarscacello” one also sees the spelling “Sarscocello” in the diaries, but they are pronounced identically: “Sar&#8242;skuhsillaw&#8242;.” In these English versions, “c” represents in the first instance the sound of “k” and in the second instance the sound of “s,” as though it is first “c” from the Roman alphabet and then the Cyrillic “c,” the equivalent of English “s.” Thus, where one would expect the English pronunciation “chello” as in Monticello, we get instead “sello.”</p>

His christening took place on Sunday, 10 October 1843 [22 October NS] (Korf, pp. 303–305).

			<p class="Endnote-text4">Maxwell has left an amusing account of Todd’s invitation to and attendance at the christening: </p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">I think I told you in a former letter of the birth of a prince; the lineal heir to the Imperial honours. Great has been the rejoicing thereupon. The first intimation I had of the event was an unusual firing of cannon; the next, a visit from a Master of Ceremonies ‘pour annoncer l’heaureuse délivrance de Son Altesse Impériale, Madame la <span class="CharOverride-S">Grande</span><span lang="ar-SA"> Césarevna Grande Duchesse Marie Alexandrovna et la naissance de Son Altesse Impériale le Grand Duc Nicholas Alexandrovitch’. Then followed a proclamation from the Emperor to his well beloved subjects directing a general Te Deum throughout the empire and finally a circular was issued to the Court giving the necessary information respecting the process of baptism. I enclose you one of these Circulars in French; let Ag [his sister, Agnes] translate it for you. In the Circular no mention is made of the place or position assigned the ‘Corps diplomatique’ and I verily thought at one time that this interesting set of wise acres were intentionally left out. His Excellency Colonel Todd was really quite astonished at the oversight and only recovered his ministerial composure upon the reception of a note inviting him, and not me, to the holy ceremony. The Secretarys and such small fry were beneath notice on such an occasion and Ambassadors and Envoys ‘</span><span class="CharOverride-1">all</span> the go’ As to my individual self it was a matter of perfect indifference whether I went or not and the truth is it was greatly for my interest not to go at all. The place of ceremony is fifteen miles from here and I would have had to incur considerable expense to have gone and returned and I would not have seen more than I am almost tired of seeing already. His Excellency left here at 6 in the morning, was on his feet most of the day, soiled his uniform in the rain, and has been laid up with a cold ever since; the only particular indemnification he received on this particular occasion being (to use his own words) ‘the honour of dining for the first time at the very same table with an Emperor’. (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Nov. 1, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 24)</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text-after-quote">Maxwell’s private response to the birth of the Grand Duke Nikolai Aleksandrovich was facetious: “This is the second child born unto them since I have been in this country which is just about a year and a month, but then the winter nights are very long here” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Sept. 30, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 22). Nikolai Aleksandrovich was declared heir to the throne on 18 February 1855, the day his grandfather, Nicholas I, died and his father, Alexander II, ascended the throne. He died, however, on 12 April 1865 (in Nice), on which day his younger brother, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich, was declared heir to the throne. The body of Nikolai Aleksandrovich was brought back to St. Petersburg, where it was interred in the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul.</p>

Whatever the work was that she gave her sons for Christmas, it had to have been published no later than December 1843.

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">Soon after ten I went above stairs and wished the Whistlers a merry day and offered the Major and the Majors daughter, tickets to the first great ball of the Nobility in the evening. The Major who had been sick for some days was still too ill to think of going out and I myself could not expect to take charge of the youthful daughter, even if agreeable to herself or her Father, for it would not be proper as things are constituted here. Miss W was a little disappointed but had not much to regret as we will see hereafter. Having accepted to dine with them at 4 P.M. I left … After two or three other calls. I returned and dressed for dinner. Soon after going aloft I handed M W, to the table and with three other American guests sat down to an excellent dinner. Just as I finished my coffee I was summoned to attend my German Professor … Then it was time to dress for the ball … I presented M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> W. with a few jars of Russian preserves, and divers specimens of Russian cakes and confectionary. To the young lady I sent some bonbons and three of the <span class="CharOverride-S">best</span> Opera’s of the best composer’s, to the Major I sent some fine French fruit, including St Germain pears, for which I paid one ruble each, and the boys I gave some trifling affairs as playthings.

			<p class="Endnote-text-after-quote">Maxwell also made clear in this letter that he was talking of “Christmas our style,” that is, according to the Gregorian Calendar. In saying that Deborah Whistler did well by not being present at the ball, Maxwell had in mind that the ball at a later hour changed to a masquerade, which was open to all classes of society who chose to buy tickets to it, and she might, therefore, have been offended (see <a href="images_13.html#image374" target="_blank">Image 374</a>).</p>

Legh Richmond (see <a href="images_8.html#image189" target="_blank">Image 189</a>) presented the material in a poem called “The Solar System.” It consists of an introduction, eleven stanzas describing the sun, planets, asteroids, and comets, and a conclusion devoted to the glorification of God the Creator. The poem was published in 1833 for its usefulness to other children. See <span class="CharOverride-1">Domestic Portaiture</span>, pp. 36–40. It is not possible to say when Anna and Major Whistler became aware of the book, but by 1843 it had passed through several editions.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Legh Richmond (Liverpool 29 January 1772 – Turvey 5 May 1827), evangelical divine, entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1789, where “he obtained considerable proficiency in the practice and theory of music.” He suffered from weak health, as well as being permanently lame from a childhood accident. He received the BA (aegrotat degree) in 1794. In 1797, he married Mary Chambers of Bath. In 1799, he received the “M.A., and was ordained to the curacy of the parishes of Brading and Yaverland in the Isle of Wight,” with his residence in Brading. Under “the influence of … Wilberforce’s ‘Practical View of Christianity’,” shortly after coming to the Isle of Wight he “first adopted those strictly evangelical views with which his name was thenceforth associated.” Here, too, he gathered the material for “his three famous tales of village life”: “The Dairyman’s Daughter,” “The Young Cottager,” and “The Negro Servant,” which he wrote in 1809, after having left the Isle of Wight, and published between 1809 and 1814 under the name “Simplex.” Instantly popular, “they were reprinted by the Religious Tract Society in 1814 under the general title of ‘The Annals of the Poor’.” The book was translated into many languages, “obtained a very wide circulation in America,” and was estimated to have reached a circulation “in the English language alone” of two million copies during Richmond’s lifetime. In spring 1805, Richmond became “assistant chaplain to the Lock Hospital in London,” but on 30 July of the same year “was inducted into the rectory of Turvey in Bedfordshire.” Here, he became a popular preacher, drawing an audience from other towns as well, as “[c]lergymen of ability holding evangelical views were rare.” He was also “among the earliest clergymen to initiate and encourage” village benefit societies. He was, as well, deeply involved “in the establishment of the great evangelical societies like the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Church Missionary Society, and the Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews,” undertaking “extended and successful preaching tours … to collect money for them.” In 1806, he became editor of the series <span class="CharOverride-1">Fathers of the English Church</span>. Eight volumes “of selections from the writings of the English reformers” appeared between 1807 and 1812, but the venture was not a financial success, and in 1814 his friends “with some difficulty” covered the losses. In 1814, he was also appointed personal chaplain by the Duke of Kent. In 1820, while on a preaching tour in Scotland, Richmond visited Iona, which had no church or resident Christian minister. Although he raised some £92,000 to remedy this lack, the Duke of Argyll, owner of the island, himself undertook to build “a church, minister’s house, and school.” Richmond’s fund was used instead to set up “a free library for the island.” In 1822, memorials were erected in the Isle of Wight to the cottagers whom Richmond had made famous, and he himself was present at the ceremony. In 1825, Richmond’s second son, Wilberforce, died at Turvey of consumption, and, shortly after, his eldest son, Nugent, died at sea of fever, while returning home from India after a long absence. Richmond’s already-delicate health was further undermined, and he died on 8 May 1827 (<span class="CharOverride-1"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Richmond,_Legh" target="_blank">Dictionary of National Biography</a></span>, s.v. “Richmond, Legh [1772–1827]”; <span class="CharOverride-1">Domestic Portraiture</span>; Grimshawe, <span class="CharOverride-1">Memoir of Richmond</span>).</p>

He studied law in the only law school in America at that time, in Litchfield, Connecticut, and at twenty-one was admitted to the bar in North Carolina. The death of his wife, Emma Kirby, whom he had married in 1823, influenced a decision to become a cleric. In 1827, “he was ordained … a minister of the Protestant Episcopal Church.” He served for about a year in New Haven, Connecticut, where he also married again, and then in Philadelphia. He next was called to New York, serving briefly at St. Stephen’s Church and then, for twelve years, at St. Thomas’s. He came to be considered “a pulpit orator” of “very remarkable ability.” In 1835, he pubished several volumes in a children’s series called the “Boys’ and Girls’ Library,” which consisted of dialogues between a knowledgeable “Uncle Philip” and an inquiring audience of children. In 1836, he “visited England … for the purpose of obtaining copies of … documents … related to the early history of the Episcopal Church in America,” some of which he later published. In 1837, he established, with a colleague, the <span class="CharOverride-1">New York Review</span>, to which he contributed two outstanding articles: one on Thomas Jefferson and the other on Aaron Burr. In 1839, he established the St. Thomas’ Hall School on Long Island that failed financially and bankrupted him. He was also connected with the N-YHS (founded in 1804), which he helped “to restore … to life and usefulness” in the late 1830s, when it was in a period of decline. From 1849 to 1859, he was on its Executive Committee; from 1855 to 1859, he was the First Vice-President of the American Ethnological Society (organized in 1842); and from 1855 to 1861, he was President of the American Geographical and Statistical Society. From 1836 to 1863, he published works “relating to American history, civil and ecclesiastical.” In 1843, he accepted a call to Mississipi, where he spent about one year before accepting a call to New Orleans, where he served for five years. In 1849, he “was recalled to New York” to become rector of Calvary Church, and a subscription was raised to eliminate the debt he had incurred in establishing the St. Thomas’ Hall School. In 1861, out of sympathy with the Southern cause, he resigned from Calvary Church and accepted a call to Christ Church in Baltimore. He returned after some two years to New York and eventually became rector of a new church, which was called the “Chapel of the Holy Saviour.” On 4 September 1866, he spoke at the cornerstone ceremony of this new church. On the twenty-seventh, he died. He was buried in Greenwich, Connecticut. (All quotations are taken from Evert A. Duyckinck, <span class="CharOverride-1">A Memorial of Francis L. Hawks, D.D., LL.

There is “a list of his sermon titles from … October 1864 to June 1866” at the N-YHS; almost “all of his titles are short lines of New Testament scripture.” As “most of his sermon-writing was done during his rectorship at St. Thomas Church … (1831 to 1843),” I was directed there.

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">The Major has discovered that he has lost his flute as well as the writing case. This flute, a very fine one he paid 20 guinea’s for many years ago in London and he valued it as an old companion above all price. We have sent to the police, the officers have been here, searched without finding, carried off a young man who was a waiter, who had not been very long in St. Petersburg, who spoke German and a little Russian, and who is generally suspected as the robber. They attached a rope to his arm and in this way took him off. At the police office, he charged it upon the Dvornik or Court yard keeper, a poor ignorant wild Russian who is half frightened to death and who has likewise been before the police. But they have both been released, and the officers after manifesting very little care in the matter seem to have dropped t<span class="CharOverride-S">he matter</span>. the enquiry. My old fox of a servant [La Ronne] was out with me late on the night of the robbery. I sent him home from the French theatre with the carriage, and returned myself with a friend sometime after midnight when we took supper. It is impossible to say with confidence whether he knows any thing of it or not. He has access to every thing I have, and as I trust to him I thought best to inform him that if any thing was gone I would shoot him, a privilege I have by virtue of my office. But I really pity the Majors family in such a state of affairs. They have been <span class="CharOverride-S">so</span> unaccustomed to lock up from their servants, but to treat them kindly and with confidence. Those they have they pay better and treat better than they <span class="CharOverride-S">are</span> could expect, and to be plundered in this impudent way is outragous. The man that is suspected cannot speak one word of English and the only way of directing him was through the quickly acquired German of Miss W. The worst of the matter is, that having applied to the police, he (Major W) will be exposed to the extortions of this body of swindlers for some time to come, nor will he ever recover his things, if they are found, without paying the finder their full original value. The only way to live in security here is, either, to have little and lock that up yourself as securely as you can and trust to luck or to have much and pay a princely salary to the man you think honest enough to be your maître d’hotel, and master of your house from top to bottom. In this last case. you hold one person responsible. and are relieved from much embarrassment. (John S.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">This was not the first time that Major Whistler’s premises had been robbed. In September 1843, not long before the arrival of the Major’s family, Maxwell wrote his mother at length about the theft of a large sum of money from the Major’s rooms, his carelessness with his money, the preferential treatment be received, and crime in St. Petersburg in general: </p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">Our quiet household has been disturbed by a very serious occurrence. although a common one in St. Petersburg. Major Whistlers rooms upon the basement [ground] floor were entered from the windows on the street night before last [Thursday, 8 September], his desk drawer broken open and six hundred dollars in paper roubles taken therefrom. In a port folio in the same drawer there was about the same amount of money, (all of which he had received from the Government the day before) which the robbers did not discover. They took however two gold eagles, <span class="CharOverride-S">of</span> American coin, and left one which they, in their haste could not have seen. There was much other valuable property in the room and the Colonel of the Police and Aide de Camp to Pevrofsky [L.A. Perovskii (1792–1856)], Minister of the Interior, who visited the premises, expressed it as his opinion that the theft was committed by some person living on the premises and knowing the money to be in the drawer. This is the opinion of the Major and mine, and Colonel Todds. for no one could, except some one who saw it, know that the money was in that particular drawer. The officer who visited the house at the request of his Excellency Col Todd; for we are exempt by virtue of our position from the voluntary attentions of the police; requested permission to work secretly and use extraordinary measures to detect the robbers. The permission has been granted and I have no doubt agents are about us who will discover something, although Major W. will never recover a cent, as I am informed that nothing is ever restored to the owners. Major W is rather careless with his money, and as there are no ordinary banks of deposite, is liable to meet with accident, particularly <span class="CharOverride-S">here</span> as there are very numerous thefts now every day in the neighbourhood. It is a little remarkable that the police force of the quarter or district on the morning preceding the robbery, summoned before them our <span class="CharOverride-S">dvor</span> dwornick or person who sweeps the sidewalk and court yard, and informed him that as the long nights were approaching fast, he must keep a watch with his neighbour dwornicks, for they would not answer for any burglary that might be committed in the neighbourhood. Certain it is many robberies are committed, and murders too. We hear of them occasionally, but the great majority of cases are never known to the public, as there are no newspapers or person’s permitted to mention such events. (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Sept. 9, 1843, entry dated Sept. 10, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 21). </p>

The store owned by Matvey Ivanovich Bernard (1794–1871) (his name also appears as Bernardaki and Bernar) on the corner of the Nevskii Prospekt and Bol’shaia Morskaia Street was the best-known of them. Bernard was himself a pianist and in Moscow had been the student of John Field (1782–1837), the famous Irish pianist. He moved to St. Petersburg in 1822, where he became a well-known teacher and a composer. In 1840, he founded the monthly sheet music journal <span class="CharOverride-1">Nuvellist</span>, which appeared right up until 1917. His son Nikolai Matveevich Bernard (1844–1905) inherited the family business. It was purchased in 1885 by a man named Jurgenson. (A.V.

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">I repaired to the palace in the ordinary way, and where I was received in much the same way as I have heretofore described. The only remarkable <span class="CharOverride-S">event I and</span> sensation I experienced on the way at all novel was the excessive cold. The morning was beautiful, bright and clear but so cold that every thing seemed ready to crack. The manes of the horse’s and the beards of the men were white with frost and whatever was touched with the naked hand sent an icy chill into every nerve and muscle of the arm. The Thermometer stood at 2 degrees and ¼ below Zero Farenheit and at 16 <span class="CharOverride-90" lang="ar-SA">½ Raumer. The temperature of the Palace was very agreeable. I joined the Corps in the Salle des Marêchaux or hall of the Marshals, and from there went with them into the Imperial Chapel. We were the first introduced into this magnificent room, and took up a position next the railing, which divided the alters from the main body of the room. so that we had a fine chance to observe all that occurred. All the diplomats were there except Lord Stuart. In our select company were included Lady Stuart, the ladies of the Saxon and Sardinian Ministers, a few distinguished strangers and the Roman Catholic Bishop. We had remained long in our places when the doors were thrown open and the Grand Masters of Ceremony with their </span><span class="CharOverride-S">ushe</span> batons ushered in the procession, headed by the Metropolitan and the Bishops in long robes of all colours, with great big chimney pot looking caps on their heads, and their beards and hair hanging on their backs and breasts - Next came the Imperial family according to age and rank, and finally came the officers of states and ladies of the court. The priests and the Imperial family passed through a gate in the railing, directly in our front and the Court people filled up the room directly in our rear. The Priests commenced reading prayers, when the Emperor took the Prince Hesse by the arm and placed him in position before the alter, and the Empress took the G Duchess Alexandra and placed <span class="CharOverride-S">on</span> her next him. The Metropolitan then placed a lighted candle in the hands of each one and then the ceremony of the service was continued for a long while, by <span class="CharOverride-S">rea</span> the prayers and responses of the clergy. Then the Metropolitan placed rings on their fingers after which the Empress approached and taking the rings from off the finger of the Prince she placed them on those of the Duchess, and <span class="CharOverride-S">then</span> the <span class="CharOverride-S">rig</span> rings of the Duchess she placed upon the fingers of the Prince. Then commenced delicious music from the choir - all vocal, but superior to any instrumental music you ever heard and said to be the finest sacred melody in the world - After this the Greek Cross was carried about with the invocations of the Bishops, and was presented to the bride and groom to kiss - which being done, the happy pair, approached the Emperor and Empress and the rest of the family and kissed and were kissed again in the most affectionate matter. Such kisses it was good to see and hear. They were none of your half and half affairs, but regular smacks which resounded beneath the arched vault above us. After this interesting process the affianced couple repaired again to the alter, and kneeled down. The Imperial family done the same and the whole audience of course followed suite. I went down on my marrowbones without any difficulty for I never strap myself up as many do for these occasions, being perfectly satisfied with the shape nature has imposed upon me. But unfortunately this is not the case with courtiers generally and old diplomatists in particular. Some of these from the unbending stricture of their stuffed coats and the unyielding nature of their unmentionables found it hard work to get down. I saw one on all fours, another leaned on me for support, and his Excellency who stood in front as stiff as a poker, let himself down by a masterly manouvre, and without apparent damage, although <span class="CharOverride-S">a</span> I thought the sound I heard of rip and tear proceeded from angry discussion <span class="CharOverride-S">any</span> among the seams of his tightened garments. As soon as the prayers were over, the cannon commenced firing, the Imperial Family retired as they came and we were at liberty to retire too. As I was going out I met M<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">Ƥ</span> Bodisco in full Russian costume … The Colonel hastened away with such trepidity that I finally concluded he had damaged his pantaloons, although I did not like to ask him if such was the fact, for he is too much of an Adonis in his own estimation, to have any one else think otherwise and I did not think it safe to offend him by seaching [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] the truth more particularly for so an un-adonis-like mishap. The ceremony interested me more <span class="CharOverride-S">particularl</span> than any thing I have witnessed in some time. The solemnity, the importance of the parties, the novelty of the scene the peculiarity of the Greek devotions, the dress of the Bishops, the sounds of the prayers uttered in the ancient Slavonian, and the beautiful music, all combined, made a powerful impression upon me. I shall never forget it. (John S, Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Jan. 1, 1844, entry dated Jan. 8, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 27)</p>

In the reign of Alexander I (see <a href="images_15.html#image418" target="_blank">Image 418</a>), he participated, as a regimental doctor, in the military campaigns against Napoleon and against Sweden and acquired extensive experience in battlefield surgery. In 1814, he served as chief medical inspector of the Russian troops in France and, through March 1815, was in charge of the hospitals he personally organized. As of 1820, he was head doctor of the St. Petersburg Artillery Hospital. He devoted himself to surgery and became known for his outstanding success in averting post-surgical deaths. As a result of his long service and the level of knowledge exhibited by him in both medicine and surgery, he was awarded in October 1821 the degree of Doctor of Medicine without taking the examination for it or writing a dissertation. This was unprecedented in the history of Russian medicine. In March 1827, he retired and took up private practice. From 1828–1845, he was chief consultant at the Obukhov Hospital, where he worked without salary. In 1829, he treated Nicholas&#160;I and was appointed His Majesty’s personal physician, serving in this capacity for the next ten years. He was initial in establishing the code of regulations of the St. Petersburg Children’s Hospital (December 1834) and was the hospital’s first consultant.

I have a room for my servant, coal, house, stable if necessary etc in the Court yard. My servant at present is the old chasseur of his Excellency. His name, La Ronne. He pretends to speak English, French, Swedish and Russian but I doubt if he fully comprehends either. I have to give him ten dollars a month and he finds himself. All servants here have to find themselves. This is the rule, but if one does not lock every thing up, they find themselves at the expense of the master” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Sept. 30, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 22). The verb “to find” has here the meaning of “to provide food and lodging.” This is most familiar in the British (often naval) expression “all found,” which is said of an employee’s wages and means “with board and lodging provided free: <span class="CharOverride-1">your wages would be five shillings all found</span>.” (<span class="CharOverride-1">Oxford English Dictionary</span>, 3rd ed. [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010], s.v. “find, <span class="CharOverride-1">v.</span>”). </span></p>

He had been stripped of his finery when he left the Colonel and came to me. He looked very fierce and with great contempt upon the new chasseur dressed in the old insignia of office” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Nov. 15, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 25). Like his fellow Orthodox Russians, he adhered to the strict fasting of Lent: “I offered my servant some [calves foot] jelly. and although he loves good things and had eaten nothing but <span class="CharOverride-S">flour</span> bread and salt for 5 weeks he would not touch it” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Mar. 26, 1844, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 29).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">La Ronne’s surname we learn when Maxwell is leaving Russia for the summer in 1844: “even my faithful Laronne Schipouleff, my very diplomatic valet, preferred to keep the money I had given him to pay his way to and from the Alexandra, to going with <span class="CharOverride-S">the</span> his master any further than the quai” (John S. Maxwell to George Washington Whistler, from Berlin, Thursday, June 20, 1844, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers). Maxwell came to know his virtues. “I have had to increase the wages of my servant La Ronne in order to retain him in my service. I now pay him at the rate of sixteen dollars a month. He is worth that to me, for he knows how to wait, knows a little of all the European languages, finds out every thing that is going on, understands all the etiquette, is respectful, well dressed, and wears a very fine pair of mustaches, in fact he is a person who unites the knowledge and experience of the servant, the courtier and the Diplomate.

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">The severity of a polar winter, acting on a constitution acclimated to warmth alone by so many year’s sejourn under the tropical sun of South America, gradually undermined his health and weakened his frame … he cheerfully made his preparations for re-embarking for her shores by the first homeward steamer in May … On the 3rd of that month, he went by appointment to take his leave of the Emperor … The farewell he received was accompanied by an invitation for a revisit, when the just begun new bridge of granite, to unite the two shores of the Neva, should be finished … Meanwhile the heat of a summer sun, in a land which has no medium transition between the seasons like our spring, had that morning burst the hitherto winter cloud over the city. Every creature, more or less, feels the abrupt change; but the effect on him we lament was almost instantaneous. During his drive home, which was short, the excessive heat appears to have suddenly thawed the hitherto almost frozen up blood in his veins. In that extraordinary congelation, to his feelings, was always the term in which, whenever he did suffer himself to complain of his sensations, he described them and their petrifying influence oftentimes on his spirits. And, alas! before he reached the house door, the fearful reaction of the blood set a-flow had gushed with such violence towards his head, that when he stept from his carriage, which he did without assistance, he was observed to stagger; and then, by the aid of his servants, he walked into the house. But when he had reached the room where his sister was, he neither spoke nor opened his eyes more. Two physicians were instantly on the spot. Every means that medical skill could apply were used to produce some sign of revival, but in vain. For fourteen hours he continued to breathe, but lay pale and motionless as a statue, and at half past six o’clock, the ensuing morning, his mortal life became extinct.” (Obituary, Sir Robert Ker Porter Papers: box 6, no. 665, Huntington Library, San Marino, CA)</p>

Since the end of 1839, it has been located in a building built for it on the corner of Novo-Mikhailovskaia Street and Mikhailovsky Square (or Italianskaia Street). The purpose in setting it up was to create a gathering place in which the participants could find pleasure in dances, permitted games, the reading of newspapers, and other pursuits appropriate to an educated society. Members are hereditary nobles from all over the Empire. Guests at balls and masquerades and visitors on ordinary days may be non-hereditary nobility, honorary citizens, famous artists, and Russian and foreign merchants. Males under 17 years of age and females under 16 are not permitted. There are two categories of membership: permanent members, who have access to the hall at any time; and visitor members, who have access only to the six balls or masquerades held annually. Permanent members each receive two tickets to the balls for the ladies in their family. The number of permanent members is reckoned to be over six hundred. Persons belonging to the social groups named above and temporarily in St. Petersburg may be visitors on ordinary days, while nobles owning their own homes in the capital, in service here and already members of other assemblies and clubs may not. The latter must be members. Twelve visitors are permitted each day and may retain this privilege for no longer than six months. The Assembly Hall is open daily from nine in the morning until two in the morning. On the days when there is a ball or masquerade, the public may not enter earlier than one hour before the event. The Assembly Hall is closed the last three days before Easter. The balls, which in recent years have been combined with masquerades, constitute the main charm that the Assembly Hall of the Nobility holds for the capital. The magnificent and spacious hall illuminated by crystal chandeliers offers many conveniences for these festive occasions. The hall is encircled by columns, behind which are raised galleries accessible by a few steps. From these galleries one can watch those dancing and make one’s way around the hall without crossing the dance floor. In front of the columns around the entire hall are three rows of red divans arranged like an amphitheater. Adjoining the hall are elegant rooms for the public that are opened only on these occasions. Buffets are set up here and the public takes its ease in the coolness of these rooms after dancing. The Assembly Hall is also used for charity balls, private concerts, lotteries, etc. (Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 183–185; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, pp. 650–655). John Stevenson Maxwell described it as a “truly magnificent saloon, considered by far the finest ball-room in the world” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, January 1, 1844, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 27). The ball Deborah gave up for the opera took place on 24 January / 5 February.</span></p>

It was one of the six operas in which Viardot-Garcia (see <a href="images_8.html#image198" target="_blank">Image 198</a>) sang that season (Rozanov, p. 43). One Russian newspaper had predicted that the subject of conversation during New Year’s Day visits on 1 January 1844, would be the Italian Opera, the singing of Viardot-Garcia, and how impossible it was to get a ticket in the loges (Rozanov, p. 43). </span></p>

On 1 January 1811 (OS), it burned down, and 7 years later the reconstruction of a new building was completed. The main entrance has a portico with eight Doric columns and a statue in Carrara marble of Minerva, whose spear is a lightning rod. In 1836, the theater was remodeled by the architect Cavos. Its spaciousness and magnificent decor make it one of the most outstanding buildings in the capitol. When completely full, it can hold more than 2000 persons. During masquerades, a floor is placed over the orchestra seats on the same level as the stage for one-and-a-half hours, making the entire theater resemble a huge hall. Along with the foyer, it can then easily accommodate up to 12,000. The theater is intended exclusively for ballet and opera (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, pp. 638–640). It is located on Theater Square in the Second Admiralty District, Fourth Ward, on Nikol’skaia Street, between Ofitserskaia and Torgovaia streets, and faces the Kriukov Canal (Nistrem, <span class="CharOverride-1">Adres-Kalendar’</span>, pp. 20, 51, 52).

It is his description of the exhausted and nervous appearance of Empress Aleksandra Fyodorovna, attributed by him to the stress of (1) the Decembrist rebellion in 1825, which threatened her husband’s accession to the throne and the entire Imperial family with assassination and (2) her years of bearing children (Marquis de Custine,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Empire of the Czar A Journey through Eternal Russia</span>, foreword by Daniel J. Boorstin; introduction by George F. Kennan [New York: Anchor – Doubleday, 1990], pp. 137–138; see also pp. 159, 161). This passage, copied in Anna Whistler’s hand, is followed by her response to what she deemed to be Custine’s lack of generosity and of justness in attributing the empress’s debility to a subservience to the emperor and thereby suggesting an unhappy marriage. But although Custine was implying that the emperor had power, he was not saying the marriage was unhappy. Anna Whistler entitled the quotation an “Excerpt from the Marquis de Custines travels in Russia in 1842” (see <a href="appendix_b.html">Appendix&#160;B</a>). In his biography of Aleksandra Fyodorovna, whom he knew personally, A. Th. von Grimm corroborates in detail Custine’s statement and also does not suggest an unhappy marriage (A. Th. von Grimm, <span class="CharOverride-1">Alexandra Feodorowna Empress of Russia</span>, trans. Lady Wallace, 2 vols. [Edinburgh: Edmonston &amp; Douglas, 1870], vol. 1, pp. 157, 246).</span></p>

The Whistlers normally did not entertain, work, or amuse themselves on Sunday. Although the diaries do show that she occasionally made an exception on Sunday, I believe the date of this entry is wrong, and it cannot be a Monday. Moreover, Anna Whistler does not refer to having or not having attended church the day before, which she usually referred to when writing on Monday.</span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text4">Cooper’s family moved from his birthplace of Burlington, New Jersey, in 1790 to “a huge tract in central New York,” where his father established Cooperstown and “built a pretentious manor estate on Otsego Lake.” Cooper “spent his boyhood” here, “learning much about frontier and wilderness life from the rude inhabitants of the place” that he used “in his later writings.” Educated at Yale, he also “shipped as a merchant seaman and served for three years as a midshipman in the navy.” “He lived in New York, later in Paris, … [and] in 1833 … [returned to] Cooperstown” permanently.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4"><span class="CharOverride-1">The Spy</span> (1821), his second novel, caused a furor that made him decide to be a writer. It is considered “an entertaining mixture of fighting, espionage and love.” “The central character is Harvey Birch,” “based on a real personage” who was “a secret agent employed during the Revolution to gather information on British activities” and ran the risk of being hung by either side. Birch is “a Yankee peddler on whom George Washington (in the novel called William Harper) relies strongly. The action takes place in Westchester County, N.Y., where two bands operate, the Americans and the British. Captain Henry Wharton, of the British faction, visits his Westchester home and is almost captured, but his patriotic sister Frances persuades Mr. Harper to aid her brother. The leader of his pursuers is Major Payton Dunwoodie, betrothed to Frances. Urged by Frances to delay his pursuit, Dunwoodie uses an immediate marriage ceremony as a pretext for the delay. Birch is active in all these events, sometimes in the manner of a Yankee peddler, sometimes in the lofty style of the aristocrats. But he is depicted throughout the book as a man of noble instincts and deep patriotism who refuses all rewards.”</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Cooper, while “not especially concerned with Negro rights, … enjoyed describing Negro characters, and in … the servant Caesar … presented the first of his numerous full-drawn portraits of Negroes.”</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">“Sir Walter Scott’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Waverley</span> (1814) influenced Cooper in writing [<span class="CharOverride-1">The Spy</span>] and later novels. At times he makes the somewhat primitive Westchester seem like a land of chivalry transported from the Scotch Highlands or the Middle Ages. Mr. Harper resembles Bonnie Prince Charlie … rather than the actual commander of the American armies.”</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4"><span class="CharOverride-1">The Spy</span> is also said to demonstrate “that Cooper was always … ‘a loose, slovenly author’” (Herzberg, <span class="CharOverride-1">Reader’s Encyclopedia of American Literature</span>, pp. 209–210).</p>

(Chris Carola, “Dandy New Theory Suggests ‘Yankee Doodle’ is Now 250,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</span>, July 5, 2008). At the outset of the American Revolutionary War, “as opposition to British rule in the American colonies heated up, satirical songs took on a new edge. Rebellious colonists sang songs insulting Britain’s king, George III, as a drunken tyrant, and British soldiers answered with songs ridiculing the Americans as backwoods yokels.” Written years earlier for a similar purpose, “Yankee Doodle” “was so popular with British troops that they played it as they marched to battle on the first day of the Revolutionary War. The rebels quickly claimed the song as their own, though, and created dozens of new verses that mocked the British, praised the new Continental Army, and hailed its commander, George Washington. By 1781, when the British surrendered at Yorktown, being called a ‘Yankee Doodle’ had gone from being an insult to a point of pride, and the song had become the new republic’s unofficial national anthem” (“<a href="http://www.loc.gov/teachers/lyrical/songs/yankee_doodle.html" target="_blank">Yankee Doodle</a>,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Historical Period: The American Revolution, 1763-1783</span>, Library of Congress online, accessed 30 April 2020).</span></p>

Mr. Gassaway went on to be Rector of Saint George’s Church in St. Louis in 1850, where he was tragically killed in an explosion on a river boat in 1854.” His pastoral skills “apparently were exceptional” (Glenn A.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">It is less likely that Anna Whistler may be referring to George Catlin’s portraits of North American Indians. Catlin (26 July 1796 – 23 December 1872) began creating a gallery of paintings of North American Indians in 1829–1830, which he completed in 1838. This gallery of paintings and objects was exhibited in the United States in 1837–1839. In 1839, Catlin took it to London. The exhibit opened on 1 February 1840, at Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly (see <a href="images_4.html#image79" target="_blank">Image 79</a>), where it was on view for three years. Major Whistler, on route to Russia, was in England from some time in the latter part of June 1842 until 18 July 1842, and might have seen the exhibit then. The collection remained in England until the end of 1844 and was exhibited in Manchester, where Anna Whistler and the children could have seen it in 1843.

Even before going to college, he helped establish “the first Sunday school at Chelsea,” an interest that he continued to maintain later (and one that probably endeared him to Anna Whistler).

Its external appearance had not changed by the 1850s, but had been enhanced in recent times by the presence of luxury stores rivalling some of the best stores on the Nevskii Prospekt. Here there were individual shops selling, for example, mirrors, perfume, tobacco, china, table linens, yard goods, furniture, antiques, and paintings. Inside the Gostinyi Dvor, with its arcades paralleling the exterior of the building, was a second set of shops with storerooms and warehouses and shops selling iron and brass wares.

Paper money, which appeared in Russia in 1769, was called “assignatsii” or “bankovskie bilety” (bank notes). At first, a paper ruble was equal to a silver one, but because too much paper money not backed by silver was released, the rate of exchange began to fall. Copper and paper money were treated as equal, but silver money was valued at a higher rate. One silver ruble began to be considered the equivalent of four paper rubles. In 1839, the rate of exchange was officially fixed, making one silver ruble equal to 3.5 paper rubles. Around 1843, state credit notes (<span class="CharOverride-1">kreditnye bilety</span>) were introduced instead of “assignatsii,” which were removed from circulation. People nevertheless called these notes by the old name for a long time (Fedosiuk, <span class="CharOverride-1">Chto neponiatno u klassikov</span>, pp. 56–57). Anna Whistler sometimes refers to the paper ruble as “banco,” from the other term, “bankovskie bilety” (bank notes), used to mean “assignatsii.”</span></p>

The school and lodgings are housed in a state-owned building on the Moika Canal at Choir Bridge (<span class="CharOverride-1">Pevcheskii most</span>). The boys are recruited when young and come mainly from the Ukraine. They receive a general and musical education in classes at the choristers’ school and are salaried. Those whose voices change enter the civil service, while those whose voices do not change remain lifetime members of the choir.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The director of the Imperial Court Chapel during the Whistlers’ St. Petersburg sojourn was Aleksei Fyodorovich L’vov (1798–1870; see <a href="images_8.html#image195" target="_blank">Image 195</a>). L’vov had no particular expertise in church music but was an “accomplished amateur violinist,” whose travels in the retinue of Nicholas&#160;I enabled him to meet “the leading European musicians of his time” and to gain “an international reputation as a musician.” He was chosen for the director’s post in 1837 by Nicholas&#160;I because of close personal ties, forged in part by his musical reputation and his training as an engineer and military officer, a training that always appealed to this emperor. More importantly, “in 1833 he won Nicholas’ special favor by composing the hymn ‘God Save the Tsar’, which became the Russian national anthem.” Wishing “to establish a uniform standard of church singing throughout his realm,” Nicholas&#160;I gave L’vov enormous powers of censorship, which he exercised to an intimidating degree. During L’vov’s 24-year tenure as director, “the only compositions added to those already approved under Bortniansky [(1751–1825) [a predecessor] were his own.” If the choice of repertoire was conservative and limited, the ordinary one-time visitor to the choir’s rehearsals would probably be unaware; however, Clara Schumann (see <a href="images_8.html#image199" target="_blank">Image 199</a>), who did not like L’vov, was aware. Together with her husband (see <a href="images_8.html#image200" target="_blank">Image 200</a>), she attended the choir rehearsal on 25 February / 8 March 1844. Her response was: “Unfortunately they sang really mediocre compositions, surely including some by L’vov” (Nauhaus, <span class="CharOverride-1">Marriage Diaries, </span>p. 250).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Still, what particularly struck “visiting foreign musicians,” but other visitors as well, were the technical excellence and sonority of the Imperial Court Chapel Choir performances, the unique mellowness of the singing, which made the “choir resemble a grandiose organ, the magnificence and effect of which upon an impressionable listener’s nervous system is beyond description.” Clara Schumann recorded that it was “the first chorus we have ever heard, the basses resemble organ basses at times, and the sopranos often sound quite supernatural, more beautiful than the most beautiful women’s voices” (Nauhaus, p. 250). And Berlioz, visiting Russia in 1847, noted: “In our time we have no doubt that the Choir of Court Singers in Russia surpasses all choirs that exist at this moment in the entire world … To compare the choral performance in the Sistine Chapel in Rome with these wondrous singers is the same as comparing a miserable little troupe of fiddlers in a third-rate Italian theater with the orchestra of the Paris Conservatoire. The effect of the music performed by this choir upon nervous people is irresistible. At those incredible accents you feel that you are being overwhelmed, almost to the point of pain, by a nervous state that you don’t know how to control. Several times I attempted in these circumstances to remain calm, straining my will power, but I could never succeed” (Most of the information in this note and all quotations, except the Schumann quotations, are taken from Vladimir Morosan, <span class="CharOverride-1">Choral Performance in Pre-Revolutionary Russia</span> [Madison, CT: Musica Russica, 1994], pp. 57–83.

Predisposed to a similar nervous receptivity by a constitution overwrought with grief at the loss of two young children in the previous two years that released in turn memories of others “that have gone before,” Anna Whistler, too, was overwhelmed.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Rehearsals took place every Friday morning and entrance was by ticket (Nauhaus, <span class="CharOverride-1">Marriage Diaries</span>, p. 250). Major, Anna, and Deborah Whistler, together with Emma Maingay, attended a rehearsal on 18 February / 1 March.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Aleksei Fyodorovich’s brother, F. Fyodorovich L’vov, was a pupil in the drawing classes of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in the 1830s, where he knew Koritskii. Later, while a student in the Department of Transport and Public Buildings, he gained access through Koritskii to K.P. Briullov’s studio, where he saw the devotion Briullov’s students had for their mentor. F. Fyodorovich L’vov himself later became a free honorary artist (F.F.

Work on it had commenced on 1/13 January 1843. Major Whistler did not live to see it completed. It was being built “from a point where the Kriukov Canal entered the [Grand] Neva on its left bank to a point on the right bank between Lines 5 and 6 near the Academy of Arts on Vasilievskii Ostrov.

The future building for the school (1806–1808), built next to the Smol’nyi Convent, was designed by Giacomo Quarenghi (1744– 1817), who considered it his masterpiece (Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, pp. 250–253, 271, 292, 295– 296, 319; Dmitrii Shvidkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">St. Petersburg: Architecture of the Tsars</span>, ill.

Later we made the tour through the inner rooms of the institute, always accompanied by a troupe of young girls, one of whom wanted to carry my gloves, another my wrist warmer, the third my shawl, etc., and wouldn’t give these back until we had arrived at the staircase, where a unanimous chorus of repeated thank-yous rang out. Despite the many embarrassments that followed one another here, the thing did give me much pleasure” (Nauhaus, <span class="CharOverride-1">Marriage Diaries</span>, pp. 264–265).

In St. Petersburg, there was a kind of fair called “the pussy willows” that was set up in front of the Gostinyi Dvor along its Nevskii Prospekt and Sadovaia Street sides. The populace celebrated under the arches of these arcades of shops, and there was a brisk trade, mainly in bunches of pussy willow branches decorated with paper flowers and wax cherubs, and in balloons, toys, and sweets. As Lent was not yet over, there was no real revelling, but the appearance of masses of people in the streets, the noise and shoving of the crowd, the witty loud cries of the pedlars and hawkers and the sellers of pussy willow branches and toys was all taken as a kind of rehearsal for the big popular celebration of Easter to come in Admiralty Square (A.F.

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">Last week (Easter week) I took my dear little friends the Major’s boys. in my carriage and falling into line with the procession of vehicles. went up and down the Square of the Admiralty, where the clown’s of the circus upon the balconies and the clowns of the crowd upon the street excited equal laughter. These boys besides their beauty are very different from all the children you see in this country. The early intelligence of youth with us is well known to be remarkable. Here this is very striking - when these boys are compared with those around them, but this character. is nothing in point of singularity to that which I especially noticed on this occasion. The Russians great and small, in hundreds filled the great square gazing upon the various objects presented for their admiration. They were not a merry nor a noisy assemblage as we comprehend <span class="CharOverride-S">this</span> the merriment and noise of an assembly. <span class="CharOverride-S">and</span> but the very youngest of them all seemed as demure and sedate as if stricken in years.

Look there! haurra! hallo! sung out the youngsters in great glee every few moments, to the astonishment of the passers by. who perhaps trembled for the audacity of the rising generation. Little did they dream that the musical voices that were ringing in their ears, and the sparkling eyes and fine curling heads of hair, they saw belonged to a free and far off land, and that in their midst, these gifts of nature seemed alone the gifts of God to the sons of freedom.

I entered within the railing, surrounding the superstructure; – a step or two brought me near the low door way, and through this I descended about two feet and found myself in a small room or vault, filled with images encased in gold and silver, and before which burned many lights, lights I am told which are never permitted to expire, Before me was a white slab of marble, and upon this they told us, the body of our Lord was laid. It is not necessary for me to state the emotions I experienced when I looked at this – this which millions have looked upon with veneration, this which the millions of the Crusades had died to recover from the Infidels, this which was the object of the adoration of the thousands of Pilgrims around me and which ten’s of thousands would suffer much to see. I, at last, had made the Pilgrimage and with all the consolation this could afford me I retired from the Holy Sepulchre – (John S.

The earlier Kazan Cathedral was built in 1733. The present cathedral was designed and built by the architect Andrei Nikiforovich Voronikhin (1759–1814). Constructed over a period of ten years, it was consecrated on 15/27 September 1811.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Both the exterior of the Kazan Cathedral and the Corinthian columns adorning it are made of Pudozh limestone, which is yellowish-gray in color. It was used as well for the architraves, bas reliefs, statues and other decorations. The capitals of the columns are also of Pudozh stone, while the bases are of cast iron. The portico on the Nevskii Prospekt side is embellished with colossal bronze statues of John the Baptist and princes Vladimir, Alexander Nevsky, and Andrew the First-Called. The magnificent bronze doors located on this side were modeled on the famous “Gates of Paradise” of the Baptistry in Florence. The semicircular colonnade consists of 132 columns and is 40 sazhens in diameter. It contains a colossal bronze statue of the Archangel Gabriel at one end and the Archangel Michael at the other, each on a granite pedestal. The cupola of the building, 9 sazhens in diameter, consists of six rectangular Corinthian pilasters and is covered by an oval vault with a gilded cross on top. The cathedral, including the cross, is just over 33 sazhens high. The internal structure of the cathedral is cruciform. In the center rises the cupola with its sixteen windows. From the four pillars under the cupola there is a double-rowed Corinthian colonnade of 56 pink Finnish granite columns going in four directions, to the main altar and the three main doors of the cathedral. Each column has a bronze capital and base. There are three altars. The main altar is dedicated to the Kazan Mother of God, that on the right to the Birth of the Most Holy Mother of God and that on the left to Antonii and Feodosii, the miracle-working saints of the Kiev Cave Monastery.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The miracle-working icon of the Kazan Mother of God, in a mounting (<span class="CharOverride-1">riza)</span> of pure gold decorated with precious stones and pearls, is to be found in a special case on the main iconostasis to the left of the Royal Doors. This icon accompanied the Russian Army in 1812. The iconostasis of the main altar is covered in silver donated by the ataman of the Don troops, who had seized it from the French, who had pillaged it in Moscow. Trophies of the wars of 1812, 1813, and 1814 hang over the tomb of Prince Mikhail Illarionovich Golenishchev-Kutuzov-Smolenskii (5/16 September 1745 – 16/28 April 1813), commander-in-chief of the Russian Army, who was buried here in 1813. In the square in front of the cathedral on the Nevskii Prospekt are bronze statues of Prince Kutuzov and Prince Mikhail Bogdanovich Barclay de Tully (1761–1818), also a hero of 1812, which were unveiled on 25 December 1837 / 6 January 1838. On the east side of the cathedral is the Catherine Canal and Kazan Bridge; on the west side there is a semicircular square (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 2, pp. 197–208; Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 277, 552; Antonov and Kobak, <span class="CharOverride-1">Sviatyni Sankt-Peterburga</span>, vol. 1, pp. 83– 87; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, pp. 132–136).</p>

Its court yard and building come out in back onto Mikhailovskii Square. The church is built on a spot granted by Empress Anna Ioannovna in ukases of 1738 and 1739. The project for designing the church, entrusted first to Pietro Antonio Trezini (1710–1768), was given in 1759 to Vallin de La Mothe, who basically changed it. The foundation of the building was laid on 16/27 July 1763, but because of financial difficulties it took more than twenty years to complete. Initially the construction was directed by Antonio Rinal’di (1710–1798), at the culminating stage by the architect D. Minchaki (b. 1754). The money for its construction was given partly by the state treasury, partly by donation. The most extensive help in collecting the money and in building the church and church buildings came from a Bavarian merchant, Andrei Pirling, who for a long time carried on his business in the so-called Nuremberg shops, which were set up on the lower floors of the façade wings of the church building. The solemn consecration of the church by the Papal Legate of Pope Pius VI, Cardinal Giovanni Archetti (1731– 1805), took place on 7 October 1783 (OS). The church has the form of a Latin cross and is crowned with a cupola. It is 44 meters long, 25 meters wide, and 42 meters high, and holds about two thousand people. The main façade has a monumental arched portal, which rests on free-standing columns. The façade culminates in a high parapet on which are placed statues of the four Evangelists and a group of angels holding a cross. Above the main entrance, to which used to lead nine wide steps, are the words “My house shall be called the house of prayer” (Matthew 21:13) and the year 1782. The interior of the church is magnificent. The altar, made of various-colored marble and crowned with a gilded bronze cross three metres high and two silver reliquaries, was the gift of Antonio Branca of Livorno. The last Polish King, Stanislaw Poniatowski (1732–1798), who died in St. Petersburg on 1/12 February 1798, is buried here, as is Marshal Jean-Victor Moreau (1763–1813), who was fatally wounded in the battle of Dresden. The clergy of this church in its early years and again from 1816 to 1892 were from the Dominican Order. During the reign of Nicholas&#160;I, the church received the boon of a loan of 500,000 paper rubles at advantageous terms to expand the church building. In 1851, it was stated to be one of the most extensive and profitable buildings in the city, with excellent stores still to be found on its Nevskii Prospekt side. On the Mikhailovskii Square side of the building was the book store of Krasheninnikov and the sale of church books took place. The entire court yard was occupied at that time by artisan tenants and others (Shul’ts<span class="CharOverride-1">, Khramy Sankt-Peterburga</span>, pp. 232–240; Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 216–217, 290; Konechnyi, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulki</span>, p. 301; Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 265; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, pp. 220–221; Antonov and Kobak, <span class="CharOverride-1">Sviatyni Sankt-Peterburga</span>, vol. 3, pp. 221–223).</span></p>

From Alexander Square, she saw “the preparations for commencing the Easter amusements” in Admiralty Square. Confusion about the route they took is caused by the fact that there actually is an Alexandra Square. It is located between His Majesty’s Own Palace and the Public Library, which are on the other side of the Nevskii Prospekt, about opposite the Church of St. Catherine. Alexandra Square takes its name from the Alexandrinskii Theater, which it is located in front of (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, p. 75).

The ice, however, is not stowed away in these great blocks, but is first crushed into small pieces, which are stamped down into a compact mass in the cellars. This mass again freezes into solid layers of ice, the lowest or ground-tier of which is never taken out, when the cellars are well constructed, but remains perpetually there, a frozen foundation two or three feet deep, upon which, each successive winter, fresh ice is piled up to a height of five or six feet. Ice is deemed such a necessary of life in St. Petersburg, that the finest house would obtain no tenant if its ice-cellar were bad. People literally cannot exist there without ice. It is in constant use. In the first place, all kinds of eatables—meat, milk, butter, etc.—are kept in the ice-cellar. Then it is mixed with water, beer, quass, and with almost all cold drinks. When there is a superfluity of it, the Petersburgers place it on the stoves and under the beds, to cool the apartments” (Jerrmann, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pictures from St. Petersburg</span>, p. 69). “In bad (mild) winters there is often a great deficiency of natural ice, for enough is wanted to fill all the cellars not only of the city but of the surrounding country villas” (Jerrmann, p. 69).</span></p>

Her English usage here of “thro the Morskoi” suggests the Russian expression “po Morskoi&#8242;” (pronounced “puhMarskoi”), where “Morskoi” is the feminine dative case, identical to the prepositional case. She also rarely detected the rolled “r” in Russian words and therefore omitted it in her spelling of them. Thus, she wrote not “Morskoi,” but “Moskoy.” There were two streets here, parallel to one another, one called Bol’shaia Morskaia ulitsa (Grand Navy Street) (pronounced “Bahlshah&#8242;yuh Marskah&#8242;yuh oo&#8242;leetsuh”), the other Malaia Morskaia ulitsa (Little Navy Street) (pronounced “Mah&#8242;luhyuh Marskah&#8242;yuh oo&#8242;leetsuh”). Bol’shaia Morskaia (see <a href="images_6.html#image109" target="_blank">Image 109</a>) was one of the most magnificent and animated streets of St. Petersburg. It started at the arch in the Staff Headquarters building on Palace Square, crossed the Nevskii Prospekt, and went on until it met and crossed Post Office Lane. At that point, it became one with the Moika Embankment. It took its name from the fact that when St. Petersburg was founded, claywalled cottages were built here for naval officers and sailors. It was paved with wood. Here were to be found part of the building containing Main Staff headquarters and the Ministry of Finances, the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the home of the Military Governor General, as well as the homes of many members of the nobility. There were also numerous shops, including luxury stores, e.g., for clothing and furniture. Malaia Morskaia was much shorter and much quieter, with less traffic. It had fewer stores and artisans and several hotels. Anna Whistler was referring to Bol’shaia Morskaia (Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Petersburg </span>1851, pp. 43–44, 341–342), even though she wrote only “Moskoy.” In another entry, she referred to a shop specifically on Bol’shaia Morskaia (entry of Saturday [April] 26<span class="CharOverride-9" lang="ar-SA">ƫ</span> [1844], NYPL: AWPD, Part I).</span></p>

The west wind naturally sweeps the waters up towards the city. If the gulf were broad at its termination … but, unfortunately, the gulf narrows gradually to a point, and that point is St. Petersburg. When a gale, therefore, blows from the west, the waters of the Gulf are blown into the Neva, and oppose the exit of those that come rolling down from the lake … The Delta of the Neva is flat and low, and there is scarcely a spot of ground in the capital that lies more than twelve or fourteen feet above the customary level of the sea. A rise of fifteen feet is, therefore, enough to put the whole city under water, and a rise of thirty or forty feet would be enough to drown nearly the whole population.

The train made two stops: Tsarskoe Selo (21½ versts from St. Petersburg) and Pavlovsk (25 versts from St. Petersburg) (Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, p. 544). It had actually been operating since the fall of 1836, but only from Tsarskoe Selo to Pavlovsk, a distance of 5 versts, and the train had at first been drawn by horses because of the failure of the steam engines for it to arrive from England (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, pp. 39, 246; Haywood, <span class="CharOverride-1">Beginnings</span>,<span class="CharOverride-1"> p. </span>122). There is a well-known story that the first time Nicholas&#160;I rode on the new railway he ordered his carriage placed on a platform car, got into it and rode thus from Tsarskoe Selo to Pavlovsk. Afterwards, he usually rode on the railway in a separate first-class car (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 40).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The regulation for establishing a company of shareholders for building the railway was approved by Nicholas&#160;I on 21 March / 2 April 1836. The founders of the shareholding company – namely, the Equerry of the Imperial Court, Count Aleksei Alekseevich Bobrinskii (Major Whistler’s landlord; see <a href="images_5.html#image86" target="_blank">Images 86&#8211;86<span class="CharOverride-2">b</span></a>); the merchants Benedict Kramer and Johann Plitt; and Franz Anton von Gerstner – put together the capital, amounting to three million rubles. The founders were obliged to agree, in signing the confirmed regulations, that they would take certain precautions for the safety of a technologically innocent public; they would, for example, have bells or some other type of warning signal on the “steam equipages,” and the passengers coming from St. Petersburg would not be allowed to get out of the cars along the route between the gate of the town they were approaching (i.e., “a wooden barrier at the city limits”) (Haywood, <span class="CharOverride-1">Beginnings</span>, p. 99) and the office where their documents would be checked (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, pp. 39–40). Because the train whistle frightened the public, it was replaced by music. An organ ordered from abroad especially for this purpose was placed in front of the smokestack of the engine. These organs played various musical pieces to the accompaniment of loud trumpets and drums and a special employee of the railway was assigned to turn the handle of the organ while the train was in motion (Vil’chkovskii, p. 246). The official opening of the railway, with all ministers and the diplomatic corps in attendance, took place on 30 October / 11 November 1837, and Gerstner himself drove the first train to Tsarskoe Selo (Vil’chkovskii, p. 40). It took thirty-five minutes, while the return trip took twenty-seven, “and speeds up to sixty versts an hour were attained” (Haywood, <span class="CharOverride-1">Beginnings</span>, p. 127). “The railway to Pavlovsk was opened … on May 22 [June 3], 1838” (Haywood, p. 136). In the 1840s, one-way fares were: first-class, 71 kopeks silver (2.50 rubles paper); second-class, 51 k. silver (1.80 r. paper); third-class, 35 k. silver (1.20 r. paper); fourth-class, 20 k. silver (70 k. paper) (R.

In a later reference, she shows that she knows it was named for Catherine&#160;I, but persists in attributing the gilding, etc., to Catherine&#160;I, seeming not to understand that the palace in that reign was only a small stone edifice.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">In 1708, Peter the Great gifted to the future Catherine&#160;I six farmsteads, including the Sarskaia (A.N. Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Palaces and Parks</span>] [Leningrad: Iskusstvo, 1964], p. 7). A small, modest, two-storied stone palace with sixteen rooms was built here between 1717 and 1723 based on plans by the architect, I. Bronshtein (Johann-Fredrich Braunstein). The commencement of a major remodeling of it into a magnificent Baroque palace (called first the Great Tsarskoe Selo Palace) occurred in the middle of the eighteenth century in the reign of Empress Elizaveta Petrovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image413" target="_blank">Image 413</a>), daughter of Peter the Great and Catherine&#160;I. The remodeling of Catherine&#160;I’s stone palace and the construction of two symmetrical wings joined to the central building by galleries was begun in 1741. The work was entrusted to a series of architects, culminating in Bartolomeo Francesco Rastrelli, “who demolished much of [his predecessors’] completed work (particularly the galleries) and added a third story to the main structure, which was extended the full length of the palace” (Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 238). Catherine the Great, prompted by a combination of taste and of contempt for her aunt’s preference for the Rococo, set about “dispersing or dissolving [its] traces” (Hamilton, <span class="CharOverride-1">Art and Architecture</span>, p. 185).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The Catherine Palace is almost a thousand feet long. “Above the rusticated ground floor, with its arcade of French windows separated by atlantes, the building is marked by white attached columns” (Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 239), which from 1753 had as their background a bright azure façade, replaced in the 1840s with an insipid and banal greenish color (Aleksandr Benois, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo v tsarstvovanie Imperatritsy Elisavety Petrovny</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo in the Reign of Empress Elisaveta Petrovna</span>] [St. Petersburg: R. Golike i A. Vilborg, 1910], p. 87). “Despite the symmetry of the facade, its culminating point is not the central structure, but rather the pentacupolar church that anchors the east wing of the palace… The resolution of the Catherine Palace in favour of its end point (a corresponding domed pavilion on the west end was later modified during the reign of Catherine&#160;II) is in accord with the horizontal essence of the structure. This principle was reaffirmed in Rastrelli’s plan for the interior …, whose main entrance was from the west wing. From that point, two parallel enfilades extended the length of the palace without the interruption of a center cluster of rooms. The later central vestibule and grand stairway, built for Catherine&#160;II by Charles Cameron (1745-1812) in 1780 …, established a midpoint that allows one to proceed to either half of the enfilade” (Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 239).</p>

An old invalid soldier commands his five or six hundred men as gardeners and overseers. After every falling leaf runs a veteran to pick it up … Every tiny leaf that falls in pond or canal, is carefully fished out; they dust and trim and polish the trees and paths in the gardens, as they do the looking-glasses and furniture of the saloons; every stone that is kicked aside is laid strait again, and every blade of grass kept in a proper position” (Kohl, <span class="CharOverride-1">Russia</span>, p. 183). “The trunks of the trees alongside the palace were periodically scraped and washed with soap, while the macadamized roads and the paths were kept as smooth as parquet floors. Special persons went about the garden after every rainfall and a peg was stuck into the ground next to every puddle. Early in the morning the indentations from the puddles were removed with a pick, fine cobblestones and sand were sprinkled into them and then they were watered and the indentations filled up… If someone threw away a piece of orange peel, a boy would run to gather it up into a basket” (Dmitrii S.

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-403"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-403-backlink">403</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vil’chkovskii describes the difference between the expenditures made and results achieved at Tsarskoe Selo by empresses Elivazeta Petrovna and Catherine the Great. In Elizaveta’s reign, all building was done in haste, everything was richly decorated, but everything was redone several times (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 23). Catherine herself likened Elizaveta’s inconsistencies to “Penelope’s labor” (Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 288; Dmitrii Shvidkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Empress and the Architect: British Architecture and Gardens at the Court of Catherine the Great</span> [New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996], p. 212). In Catherine’s reign, despite large expenditures, before building was undertaken exact estimates were drawn up and models were even made; no excess luxury was permitted. Catherine personally checked every estimate and paid close attention to the construction work, sometimes purposely coming in from St. Petersburg in the spring to inspect its condition. The external gilded decorations of the palace and pavilions on which Elizaveta’s architects spent huge sums lasted only a short time because of the instability of the materials used. Catherine had to make large expenditures just to remove everything that had rapidly become shabby and restore the respectable appearance of the façades. What was built by Catherine, on the other hand, still looks today [in 1910] as it did when just built. In a word, everything that Catherine did in Tsarskoe Selo was executed solidly and broadly, carefully finished and sustained in every detail (Benois, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 206; Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 23).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">There is another reason why everything was “still in perfect repair,” and why it seemed neat and fresh to Anna Whistler: a part of the palace had been restored less than twenty-five years before the Whistlers visited it. A fire had occurred on 12/24 May 1820, completely destroying the church and twelve rooms adjoining it, damaging and ruining all the furnishings and walls right up to the Picture Gallery. The architect Vasilii Petrovich Stasov (1769–1848) had been ordered to rebuild it all to look as it had before (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 98; Aleksandr Uspenskii, “Imperatorskii Bol’shoi Tsarskosel’skii Dvorets” [“The Imperial Great Palace of Tsarskoe Selo”], <span class="CharOverride-1">Khudozhestvennye sokrovishcha Rossii</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Art Treasures of Russia</span>] 12 [1904]: p. 419).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-404"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-404-backlink">404</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the Church of the Resurrection of the Saviour, designed by Rastrelli, was begun on 8/19 August 1745. It was consecrated on 30 July / 10 August 1756. The interior walls were sky-blue with gilded wooden carving. Rastrelli gave it a flat ceiling instead of the cupola that was usual for a Russian church. On the outside, it had five gilded cupolas. It burned down completely on 12/24 May 1820, and most of the icons perished, but it was restored “according to the old models, from memory” (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, pp. 86–87). The new church was consecrated in 1822 (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburgska</span> 1842, p. 60). There was an entrance at the carriage approach to the church where visitors, such as Maxwell’s party, could present their tickets for admission to the palace. They would then have gone up the white marble staircase built in 1843 by Stasov. It was called the church staircase because it was situated alongside the vestibule of the church (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, pp. 83– 84), which they chose not to visit that day. See also V.V. Lemus, L.V. <span lang="ar-SA">È</span>mina, E.S. Gladkova, and G.P. Balog, <span class="CharOverride-1">Muzei i parki Pushkina </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">Museums and Parks of Pushkin</span>] (Leningrad: Lenizdat, 1980), p. 46. There are no diary entries to indicate that they ever visited the church.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-405"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-405-backlink">405</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna Whistler is referring here to the enfilades with their suites of rooms. There were five suites, or “apartments.” Her comments about various rooms, ranging from Alexander I’s bedroom to the Mirror Room in Catherine the Great’s apartments, show that they walked the entire length of the palace that day, entering via the Church Wing, going through the central portion to the Zubov Wing, and back again to exit via the Church Wing. This second floor consisted of some sixty rooms, not all of which they would have had access to (Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, p. 48: plan of the second floor, end of the nineteenth century). Maxwell, in his description of their visit to the Catherine Palace, points out some of the same things as Anna Whistler, but cannot help fill out her remarks, as his own are very brief. He felt so indebted to the Whistlers for their care of him when he was sick that the excursion “afforded [him] remarkable pleasure” because it “enabled [him] to show some little attention to Madame and Mademoiselle” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, May 11, 1844, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 34). He later visited Colonel Todd for several days and then wrote a long, idyllic account of Tsarskoe Selo with exquisite vignettes of the beautiful grand duchesses (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, May 17, 1844, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 35; see also his letter to Major Whistler, Sarskoe Celo, May 20, 1844).</span></p>

A small door led from the Chinese Salon into the inner apartments of Catherine the Great, where the Mirror Room was located. The Chinese Salon had four floor-length windows and one of regular size facing the private garden, while two opened onto the square (<span class="CharOverride-1">ploshchad’</span> – although it is possible that, in describing the interior, Vil’chkovskii meant <span class="CharOverride-1">ploshchadka</span>, which means “landing,” not “square”). It was double-lighted. Its walls were covered with original eighteenth-century panels transferred here by the architect, Charles Cameron, from an earlier Chinese room of the palace. The panels, made of wood, were painted black and covered with coromandel lacquer. On them were depicted Chinese houses, inscriptions, and other decorations, all of which were gilded. The panels were in frames of black wood. Around them were fastened very precious ancient Chinese enamels. A large number of vases and dishes of Chinese and Japanese porcelain, Tibetan brass idols, and other things were arranged on semicircular pyramids. From the ceiling, painted in Chinese style, hung four chandeliers made from vases joined with gilded bronze ornament. These vases were made in Europe by Chinese workers. The Mirror Room, Catherine the Great’s favorite “working” study, was a small room with two windows facing the private garden and a door opening onto the “Mirror Landing.” All of its walls and doors were covered with mirrors divided by narrow colonettes (see <a href="images_14.html#image387" target="_blank">Image 387</a>). The ceiling was decorated with frescos in Italian Renaissance style and a glass lantern was suspended from it (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sankpeterburga</span> 1842, p. 62; Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, pp. 122, 126; Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span> pp. 37–38).</span></p>

Like the Mirror Room (see previous Note), the Lyon Room was one of several created in the 1780s by Charles Cameron in place of Rastrelli’s fourth and fifth antechambers, which Cameron destroyed. It was also in the Fifth Apartments. It had three floor-length windows facing the square. The walls were covered with yellow silk. Cameron faced the lower parts of the walls with lapis lazuli. The window and door frames were made of massive gilded bronze on a background of lapis. The fireplaces were also trimmed with lapis and decorated with figures of Carrara marble. The parquetry of the floor and the marquetry of the door panels were made from the wood of twelve kinds of foreign trees inlaid with large stylized mother-of-pearl flowers. This type of incrustation was associated in the minds of Cameron’s contemporaries with Nero’s “Golden House,” the interior of which, according to Suetonius, was decorated with gold, precious stones, and mother-of-pearl. The doors from the Lyon Room led into the Chinese Salon described in the previous Note (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 121–122; Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, pp. 44, 124; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburga</span> 1842, p. 62; Lemus et al., <span class="CharOverride-1">Muzei i parki Pushkina</span>, pp. 38–39, 45).</span></p>

In the chests of drawers are many small toilet articles and personal things of the emperor. By the mirror stand his sword and saber. On the bed is a straw mattress in a chamois cover, hair pillows in the same kind of cover, a cotton coverlet and another of piqué. On the wall are plans of Petersburg and Tsarskoe Selo.

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-412"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-412-backlink">412</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a portrait room and a picture gallery in the Catherine Palace, both located in the Third Apartments (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, pp. 100–108). The fine pictures James “wished he could stay to examine… &amp; know who painted them” were those in the picture gallery, and most of them would have been almost impossible for him to see, given their placement and his height as a child of ten. This room occupied the entire width of the palace. As a result of the fire in May 1820, the church, part of the palace adjacent to it, and the Lyceum burned down. The Lyceum was transferred to St. Petersburg in 1843. The ceiling of the Picture Gallery, by Pietro (d. 1770) and Francesco (1729– 1793) Gradizzi, was destroyed in order to contain the fire and replaced in 1820 by a new one, based “on the old model.” The work of Academician S. A. Bessonov, the painting depicted <span class="CharOverride-1">The Feast of the Gods on Olympus</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Olimp</span>). The pictures in the collection were transferred to new canvasses. The room was decorated with gilt and plaster work in Louis XV style. Three floor-length windows faced onto the park, and three onto the landing (east and west walls). Between the windows were tall mirrors with decorative panels above them containing paintings. A tall mid-18th century stove made of German tiles stood in the middle of the north and south walls, dividing them into two symmetrical parts. Equidistant from each stove were two sets of magnificent double doors with gilded carved figures of caryatids and Minerva. These walls, starting from low wooden panels with gilt carving, were covered to the ceiling, trellis-style, with pictures almost touching each other, separated only by narrow gilt baguettes. There were 130 pictures. One hundred fifteen of them had been bought in 1745 in Prague by the court painter, Georg Groot (1716–1749), “a painter of animals and birds,” by order of Empress Elizaveta Petrovna. The remaining fifteen pictures could have come from works in storage bought by Peter the Great and his agents and through purchase from foreigners in Russia, e.g., from ships’ captains. They are all oil paintings, chiefly on canvas, but also on wooden panels and copper plates. Most are by Dutch and Flemish artists, the rest by German, French, and Italian artists. Most are originals, but some are anonymous copies of works by old masters and others are attributed to their schools. There are themes from antiquity and the Bible, allegories, still lifes, landscapes and seascapes, portraits, battle scenes, architectural views, and genre scenes. Groot’s two lists of the paintings (and objects) he purchased (amounting to 195 pieces) are detailed in their description of some of their subjects. (His lists can be found in Aleksandr Uspenskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Imperatorskie dvortsy</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">The Imperial Palaces</span>], 2 vols. [Moscow: Pechatnia A.I. Snegirevoi, 1913], vol. 2, pp. 169–174). In 1755, V. Neelov (1722–1782), an “architect’s assistant,” made an inventory of the Picture Gallery, but it was based on genre, e.g., “16 waist-length male portraits,” and therefore less useful. In the 1760s, Jacob Staehlin (1709–1785), a Swabian scholar working in Russia (1735–1785), whose notes made over a forty-year period constitute an inestimable primary source for the history of the arts in 18th-century Russia, compiled a detailed wall-by-wall inventory of the collection in the Picture Gallery, for the most part giving artists’ names (J. Stählin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zapiski Iakoba Shtelina ob iziashchnykh iskusstvakh v Rossii </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">Jacob Stählin’s Notes on the Fine Arts in Russia</span>], ed. and trans. K.M. Malinovskii, 2 vols. [Moscow: Iskusstvo, 1990], vol. 2, pp. 40–44). Some of his attributions to old masters have been refuted. New attributions continue to be proffered up to the present time. The layout of the paintings is said to have remained the same from 1756 to 1941, the fire of 1820 notwithstanding. Vil’chkovskii supplied a numbered wall plan showing the location of each picture based on a room inventory for the Picture Gallery (document now in the Arkhiv gosudarstvennogo Èrmitazha<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>[Archive of the State Hermitage], St. Petersburg [hereafter, Arkhiv GE]). The publication of his book (1910) evoked criticism of his identification of some of the paintings in the Picture Gallery. He responded to this in his foreword to the second edition (1911), explaining that because a check ordered by the Imperial Hermitage was in progress, he had amended only those things that were not in doubt. The restoration of the Catherine Palace after its destruction by German troops during World War II (111 of the canvasses in the Picture Gallery had been evacuated by the Russians) entailed efforts to determine the original makeup of the collection in the Picture Gallery. The Picture Gallery as it is since 1967 is described and the text accompanied by reproductions of 130 paintings in Vera Lemus and Liudmila Lapina, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Catherine Palace Museum in Pushkin: Picture Hall</span> (Leningrad: Avrora, 1990). One hundred seven of the pictures in the original collection as described by Staehlin are still extant. One is in the Hermitage collection, eleven have perished, and the location of nine is unknown. This means that some of the paintings on the walls of the Picture Gallery today have hung there only a brief time. By comparing Staehlin’s inventory with Vil’chkovskii’s and with the reproductions in Lemus and Lapina’s book, we can suggest some of the pictures that might have been in the Picture Gallery in the 1840s (St=Staehlin, V=Vil’chkovskii, LL=Lemus and Lapina in the list that follows): Among the works (except where noted, all cited are oil on canvas) by Western European artists of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries are: (1) <span class="CharOverride-1">Knifegrinder</span>, oil on wood, signed in monogram, by David Teniers the Younger (1610–1690) (St 80, V30, LL 67); (2) the signed <span class="CharOverride-1">Battle of Poltava,</span> commissioned by Peter the Great, by Pierre Denis Martin the Younger (1663–1742) (St 57, V 31 or 52, LL 98); (3) also by Martin, the signed <span class="CharOverride-1">Actions Taking Place before the Battle of Poltava</span> (St 78), or <span class="CharOverride-1">The Battle of Poltava </span>(V31 or 52), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Battle at the Village of Lesnaia</span> (LL 97); (4) <span class="CharOverride-1">Still Life from the Hunt with Dead Game Birds</span> (St 14),<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>or<span class="CharOverride-1"> Dog Guarding Dead Game Birds</span> (V 96), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Guard</span> (LL 56), by Jan Fyt (1611–1661); (5) also by Fyt, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dead Game</span> (St 44), <span class="CharOverride-1">Still Life with Dead Hare</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">Dead Hare</span> (V 111), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Still Life with Dead Hare</span> (LL 57); (6) painting by Jean-Marc Nattier the Younger (1685–1766), <span class="CharOverride-1">Sculpture in the Form of a Woman with Attributes of This Art</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">Allegorial Depiction of Sculpture</span> (St 12, V109),<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>or<span class="CharOverride-1"> Allegory of Sculpture </span>(LL 99); (7) the signed and dated (1696) painting by Johannes Glauber (1646–1726) <span class="CharOverride-1">Landscape </span>(St 81 or 83), or<span class="CharOverride-1"> Landscape Meeting of Apollo and Daphne</span> (V 25), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Meeting of Apollo and Daphne </span>(LL 17); (8) also by Johannes Glauber, <span class="CharOverride-1">Landscape </span>(St 81 or 83), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Landscape In the Foreground Apollo Running after Daphne</span> (V 23), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Apollo and Daphne</span> (LL 18); (9) the signed and dated (1716) painting by Ottmar Elliger the Younger (1666–1735), <span class="CharOverride-1">Dido on the Pyre</span> (St 61), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Dido Consigning Herself to the Pyre after the Departure of Aeneas</span> (V 46, LL 115); (10) also by Ottmar Elliger, <span class="CharOverride-1">Capture of Cleopatra </span>(St 63), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Aeneas Introducing Himself to Dido</span> (V48), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Dido and Aeneas </span>(LL 114); (11) the signed genre painting by Jan Miense Molenaer (c. 1610–1668) called <span class="CharOverride-1">A Company of Dutch Country Folk </span>(St 69), or <span class="CharOverride-1">A Family Scene </span>(V 37, LL 25); (12) Pieter Rysbrack (1655–1729), signed painting called <span class="CharOverride-1">Landscape with Rysbrack and His Family</span> (St 52, V 19), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Landscape with a Sarcophagus </span>(LL 60); (13) signed and dated (1637) painting by Theodor van Thulden (1606–1669) called <span class="CharOverride-1">Virtue and Vice</span> (St 72), or <span class="CharOverride-1">An Allegory of Ignorance Possessing Wealth and Driving Art and Commerce Away from Itself</span> (V16), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Allegory of Ignorance Possessing Wealth</span> (LL 65); (14) painting by Andrea Celesti (1637-1712?), <span class="CharOverride-1">Judith Cutting off the Head of Holofernes</span> (St 66), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Judith and Holofernes</span> (V 12, LL 84) (bought in Italy 1717); (15) painting by Jacques Blanchard (1600-1638), <span class="CharOverride-1">Jupiter as a Golden Shower over Danaë </span>(St 49), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Jupiter As a Golden Shower Gaining Entrance to the Chamber of Dana</span><span class="CharOverride-1" lang="ar-SA">ë</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>(V 40), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Danaë</span> (LL 101) (bought in Antwerp in 1716); (16) signed painting by Gaspard or Jasper Broers (1682–1716), <span class="CharOverride-1">Dutch Fair</span> (St 22), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Fair</span> (V88 or 116, LL 47 or 48); (17) also by Gaspard or Jasper Broers, <span class="CharOverride-1">Fair with a Crowd</span> (St 36) or <span class="CharOverride-1">Fair</span> (V 88 or 116, LL 48); (18) <span class="CharOverride-1">Jupiter</span> (St 5, V 98), or <span class="CharOverride-1">Jupiter with a Striking Rod in His Hand</span> (LL 111) by Johann Karl Loth (1632–1698).

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-413"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-413-backlink">413</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishing of an Imperial model farm at Tsarskoe Selo (see <a href="images_16.html#image458" target="_blank">Images 458–459</a>) had as its impetus an interest in agriculture on the part of Empress Maria Fyodorovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image415" target="_blank">Images 415–416</a>), mother of Nicholas&#160;I (Benois, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 221). In 1810–1811, a small farm was built on the border of the Alexander Park, where it was proposed to keep big-horn cattle of the best Western European and Russian breeds and merino sheep (Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, p. 20). In 1818– 1822, the replacement of the original wooden structures by stone ones designed by Adam Menelaws (1753–1831) in the Gothic Revival style so favored by Nicholas&#160;I took place (Petrov, p. 20; Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 394; I. Iakovkin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sela Tsarskogo</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Description of Tsarskoe Selo</span>] [St. Petersburg: V tipografii departamenta Narodnogo Prosveshcheniia, 1830], pp. 145ff.). During the summer of 1820, the basic buildings were built in the rough: the cattle yard, dairy, and central pavilion (<span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury prigorodov Leningrada</span>, p. 126). In 1822, to this group of structures were added wings for the merino sheep and later a circular three-storied tower fifteen meters high (<span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury prigorodov Leningrada</span>, p. 126). The complex of oldest structures consisted of (1) a central two-storied pavilion in English Gothic style made of red brick, (2) two single-storied wings connected to the central pavilion by sections of fences, and (3) in the middle of the yard an extensive stone cowshed, also in Gothic style (<span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury prigorodov Leningrada, </span>p. 126). A parcel of field lands from the village of Kuz’mino was added to the farm and the portion of the park adjoining it began to be called the Farm Park (Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, p. 20). The mezzanine of the main pavilion had sloping walls painted to look like tents (Benois, p. 221). The farm had an interesting collection of paintings, mostly by Dutch seventeenth-century painters, specialists in depicting animals, but as time passed the best paintings were transferred to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg (Benois, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 221). It is to this model farm that Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna, ill with tuberculosis, was brought for the cowshed treatment.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Maxwell, who visited the farm with Colonel Todd, recorded: “We visited also a dairy in the grounds, belonging to the Grand Duke Alexander and filled with all kinds of cattle of the most approved breed. The stalls of the cows were as clean as the floors of a palace, and the cows themselves far gentler than many of the Princesses” (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, May 17, 1844, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 35).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-414"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-414-backlink">414</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two groups of conservatories in the park grounds. The Big Conservatory, made of stone, was built towards the end of 1753 and consisted of a central hall, glassed-in conservatories, and two pavilions. It was part of the service buildings of the palace ensemble. It was remodelled in 1820–1823, according to the design of the architect V.P. Stasov. After remodelling, it consisted of a complex of four independent two-storied buildings formed into one whole by means of connecting glassed-in colonnades. The colonnades served as hothouses for laurel trees. The baroque decoration of the façades of the Big Conservatory was completely removed, and the building took on the look of late Russian Classicism. For the rest of the nineteenth century, the building underwent repairs but no further remodelling. The head gardeners used to live in the fourth Pavilion: in Catherine the Great’s time it was Busch; in Alexander I’s Liamin. Since the reign of Alexander I, the superintendent of Tsarskoe Selo had his residence in the First Pavilion. In Catherine’s time, the architect Charles Cameron lived there. Behind the line of big conservatories, the whole area was taken up by hothouses for flowers (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, pp. 62–63; <span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury prigorodov Leningrada</span>, p. 140). There was also an extensive section of the Alexander Park to the southwest of the Cross Canal, where there had been conservatories since the 1780s. The buildings of the conservatories, hothouses, and closed cold conservatories for fruit trees were laid out in three rows. In 1819–1828, these conservatories were remodelled and partly built anew by Menelaws. In 1819–1820, he built one for cherry trees. In contrast to the majority of buildings built by him in the Alexander Park, which were in Gothic Revival style, these were in the style of late Classicism. The most interesting conservatory was the one located near the ruins of the Gothic Chapel. Its central pavilion was decorated with eight Doric pilasters, and the ends of the windows were semicircular (<span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury prigorodov Leningrada</span>, p. 122).</span></p>

It was located beyond the Obvodnyi Canal in the Narva District on the shore. The Ekateringof lands stretched as far as Chernaia Rechka, which constituted the boundary between St. Petersburg and Tsarskoe Selo districts. From the Gulf of Finland, the lands extended as far as the Narva (Peterhof) Road. On 1 May (OS), there was always a public celebration here to commemorate Peter the Great’s first sea victory over the Swedes in early May 1703 (OS). Especially noteworthy at these festivities was the spectacle of people promenading along the many avenues of Ekateringof in their carriages (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, p. 14; Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg</span> 1851, pp. 213–215).

Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, St. Petersburg, Aug. 25, 1843, N-YHS: Maxwell Papers, no. 19; see Benson in <a href="3_benson.html">Appendix&#160;E</a>). He chose instead to move “for gentility’s sake” into the Hotel de Paris, “a more fashionable, more expensive and far dirtier place,” where he took two rooms, for himself and La Ronne, and was thus “relieved from the tittle tattle, the gossip and obsequious insolence of low, <span class="CharOverride-S">cockney</span> cokney John Bulls, who love of all things to intrude if they can into the mysteries (to them) of a gentlemans life, habits and organization” (John S.

This is probably the second of the two visits that Anna Whistler said Maxwell had made to them. He was accompanied by his “crony Strokoffsky a Polish nobleman,” who had dined with him and had expressed, as on many previous occasions, his wish to be introduced to the Whistlers, having never seen an American lady. Strokoffsky was a state councilor (5th grade) in Russian government service. At the Whistlers, they met not only Emma Maingay (see <a href="images_10.html#image263" target="_blank">Image 263</a>), but her elder brother, William Bonamy (see <a href="images_10.html#image260" target="_blank">Image 260</a>), with whom Maxwell was not acquainted.

From 22 September 1838 until Michaelmas 1840, he held “the perpetual curacies of Great Bricet and Wattisham.” In 1840, he received his M.A. at Cambridge. From 1841 to May 1843, he was with Bishop Alexander in Jerusalem as chaplain to that city. From May 1844 to August 1844, he replaced Rev.

In “holding these posts he became involved with the desire of bringing together the Greek and Anglican churches.” In 1845, he published <span class="CharOverride-1">The Holy City; Or, Historical and Topographical Notices of Jerusalem; with Some Account of Its Antiquities and of Its Present Condition with Illustrations from Sketches by the Rev.

He received the BD at Cambridge in 1849. In 1860, he undertook “‘a long and arduous journey in Russia’ …, with a view to spreading knowledge of the benefits available for foreign communities at English universities.” After posts at St. Columba’s College near Dublin, King’s College, and Cumbrae College, “a tour in the East with the Marquis of Bute and several years in residence at Cambridge, [he] was presented … [in] 1869 to the important vicarage of Ringwood in Hampshire.” He died suddenly on 26 January 1878.

Every spring, it was the site of the emperor’s inspection of the troops of the Guard Corps before they set out for camp. The Field of Mars stretched along the entire length of the Summer Garden on the Swan Canal side. From the south, it was intersected diagonally by the Moika River (opposite the garden of the Mikhailovskii Palace). It was bounded from the west by a group of houses that in olden times was called Beautiful or Red Street. To the north, the field extended to the service buildings of the Marble Palace (home of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich), alongside which is Suvorov Square, with a view of the Neva. Further along, it extended to the magnificent building of the Austrian Legation (formerly the house of Prince Saltykov) and the residence of Prince Oldenburg (formerly the house of I.I. Betskii). When the capital was first planned, the Field of Mars was considered part of the Summer Garden. Later, it was turned into a meadow, called the Tsarina’s Meadow. From 1740–1742, it was a garden. A monument to Prince Suvorov-Italiiskii was at first erected at the opposite end of the field, near the Moika. At the other end of the square rose Rumiantsev’s obelisk, later transferred to the First Cadet Corps. The monument to Suvorov was later placed in an area that was freed up between Prince Saltykov’s house and the service buildings of the Marble Palace, when Prince Saltykov’s garden was destroyed. After the rebuilding of these service buildings (from 1845 through 1850), no permanent new structures appeared on the Field of Mars for the entire second half of the nineteenth century (Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 346–347; V.S.

The review is on the 18 and 19 old style [30 and 31 NS], that is on Thursday and Friday next of this week; the first for infantry, the second for cavalry. The number of the lookout is 17 and the Company limited to 4 persons” (John S. Maxwell to Major Whistler, May 27? 28? [1844], N-YHS: Maxwell Papers). Maxwell suggested that the Major and the ladies decide who would go, but could not, with his limited Russian, understand whether the invitation said boys under twelve would be admitted (John S.

She was called “the beautiful Mrs. Anderson.” According to Pyliaev, an estate on the Peterhof Road belonging to a Mr. Anderson seems to have been formed from parts of the estates of Count Vorontsov and Vorontsov’s neighbor, Count Panin, court servitors in the time of Catherine the Great. Part of Panin’s estate became the property of the counts Sheremetiev and was called “Ulianka.” Legend has it that the name came from an inn belonging to a Finnish woman named Uliana. Mr. Anderson’s dacha was said to occupy the spot where that inn had stood. Both the original Vorontsov and Panin estates were near the estate located on the eleventh verst that Shcherbatov sold to the government and that was turned into the insane asylum of All That Mourn (Pyliaev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zabytoe proshloe</span> 1889, pp. 134–142). More recent scholarship says the dacha belonged to Vorontsov, and that it was rented out up until the 1840s, when an Englishman named John (Ivan Matveevich) Anderson bought it (S.B. Gorbatenko, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergofskaia doroga Istoriko-arkhitekturnyi putevoditel’</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">The Peterhof Road: A Historical and Architectural Guide</span>] [St. Petersburg: Evropeiskii dom, 2002], p. 136). The Matthew Andersons probably spent summers in his house, which was considered “exceptional in its model orderliness and in being equipped with all amenities” (Gorbatenko, p. 136).</span></p>

In 1731, at the death of her sister, Catherine, Empress Anna Ioannovna gave this sister’s farmstead as a gift to her own personal confessor, Varlaam, archimandrite of the Trinity-Sergius Monastery near Moscow, who was then living in St. Petersburg. Varlaam transferred from the home of Anna Ioannovna’s deceased mother in St. Petersburg a wooden church, which he placed near the stone house on the property. In 1734, Varlaam founded here the New-Trinity-Sergius Monastery. On 12 May 1735 (OS), he consecrated the church in the name of St. Sergius. Varlaam died in 1737 and was buried at the monastery, which continued to be under the jurisdiction of the Trinity-Sergius Monastery in Moscow. In 1752, construction of six new stone buildings was begun. In this period, two churches were erected: in 1758, a church for the archimandrite cells, named for St. Sergius of Radonezh, the Miracleworker; in 1760, the cathedral, named for the Holy Trinity. In 1764, the Monastery was transferred to the jurisdiction of the St. Petersburg eparchy and classified as a monastery of the second class. It was elevated to the status of a monastery of the first class in 1836. As described in 1839, the Monastery had the appearance of a rectangular castle, surrounded on the outside, from the east, west, and north sides, by ponds and walks, and on the south side by two well-cultivated parterres, which bordered upon the Peterhof Road. Between the parterres lay the entry road to the monastery. There were four church edifices in the monastery: (1) the Cathedral of the Lifegiving Trinity; (2) the Church of James the Apostle and Brother of God; (3) the Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh, the Miracleworker; (4) the Church of Valerian the Martyr. Trinity Cathedral and the Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh will be discussed further in notes about Anna Whistler’s visits to them. Trinity Cathedral has a three-storied belltower on its west side. The exterior of the cathedral and belltower is decorated with Corinthian columns and pilastres and sculpted figures. The cathedral contains the miracleworking icon of St. Sergius and is therefore a place of pilgrimage in summer. The Church of James the Apostle is located in a stone wing at the entrance to the monastery on the right side, facing the Peterhof Road. It was consecrated on 22 August 1820 (OS). On the northern side of the monastery, in a line with the cells and refectory, is the Church of St. Sergius. It has five cupolas and is an example of the Orthodox basilica. It was consecrated on 18 July 1822. The Church of Valerian the Martyr is located in the home for invalids on the west side of the monastery. It was erected during 1805–1809 over the remains of Count Valerian Aleksandrovich Zubov (1771–1804), the conqueror of Derbent, who died of wounds received in battle, by his brothers and consecrated on 21 June 1809 (OS). Underneath the church is a burial grotto for members of the Zubov family. The home for invalids was established by the Zubov family at their own expense to care for thirty males of various callings, mainly wounded soldiers. There are up to forty monks in the monastery. The square within the monastery, except for the orchards and the paths, is paved with natural stone. On this square, at the north and east sides of Trinity Cathedral, is a burial ground, where illustrious persons, including foreigners and non-Orthodox believers, are buried. Many of the magnificent and elegant tomb monuments here are considered works of art.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The following feast days are celebrated in the monastery: (1) in the Trinity Cathedral, Holy Trinity Day (Pentecost) (29 May / 10 June); the Feast of the apostles Peter and Paul (29 June / 11 July); Feast of the Beheading of John, the honest, praiseworthy Forerunner and Prophet of the Lord (29 August / 10 September); (2) in the Church of St. James the Apostle, the Feast of James the Apostle and Brother of God (23 October / 4 November); (3) in the Church of St. Sergius, the Feast of St. Sergius (5/17 July); the Feast of St. Sergius (25 October / 7 November); (4) in the Church of Valerian the Martyr, the Feast of that St. Valerian who was martyred around the year 230 (22 November / 4 December).</p>

The Equerry to Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna (1807–1873), wife of Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich (1798–1849), brother of Nicholas&#160;I, was Count Aleksandr Nikolaevich Tolstoi (21 September 1793 – 23 July 1866). He was educated in St. Petersburg in the private school of the Jesuit priest, Father Gruber. Despite receiving a Catholic education, he remained devoted to Russian Orthodoxy and personally paid for the construction of fifteen Orthodox churches. He began his military service as sub-ensign (<span class="CharOverride-1">portupei-praporshchik</span>) in the Astrakhan Grenadier Regiment on 24 February 1814. In 1815, he was transferred to the quartermaster section of His Imperial Majesty’s (Alexander I) Suite, and on 30 August promoted to ensign (<span class="CharOverride-1">praporshchik</span>). In January 1817, he was transferred to the Guards staff. In 1819, he was transferred to the Horse Guard Regiment, where, on 11 March, he was appointed adjutant to Prince A.S. Menshikov (1787–1864). He was at the Congress in Leibach with Prince Menshikov, and from here was sent with dispatches to the ambassador in Constantinople, Baron G.A. Stroganov. Then for a time, he served as adjutant to Adjutant-General Prince Volkonskii. On 2 August 1822, he was appointed an aide-de-camp to Alexander I, but on 23 January 1827 (reign of Nicholas&#160;I) was relieved of miltary duties because of ill health, with the title of “kamerherr,” appointed to the Court. In February of 1827, he was appointed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent to serve with the Russian ambassador in Paris. Five years later, he transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and for some three years was charged with special assignments in the office of the governor-general of Finland. On 12 December 1834, he was made a member of the committee for Russian horsebreeding. In 1836, he was promoted to actual state councilor (4th grade), and in 1838 appointed equerry to the Imperial Court. On his return from abroad in 1840, on which trip he had accompanied Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, he was appointed to serve as equerry to her. During his continuing court service, Tolstoi held the post of marshal of the Imperial Court and Winter Palace (<span class="CharOverride-1">obergofmarshal</span>) and carried out many special Imperial assignments. When the emancipation of the serfs took place, he gifted to his peasants the payment of twenty percent of their manumission fee. In the autumn of 1865, Tolstoi went to Nice for the cure because of ill health, but died there on 23 July 1866. His body was brought back to St. Petersburg and buried in the family vault of the Lazarus Church of the Alexander Nevsky Monastary. Tolstoi was married to Anna Nikolaevna Khilkova and was without issue (Polovtsov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Russkii biograficheskii slovar’</span>, vol. 21, pp. 32–33).</span></p>

Sir William, along with his brother, had amassed great wealth through the ship’s biscuit business they had inherited from their father. Timothy Abraham Curtis’s path, in contrast, was one of bankruptcy. He was a director of the Bank of England from 1820 to 1841, including the period 1834–1837 as deputy governor and 1837–1839 as governor. He ceased to be a director in 1841, when he disqualified himself through the sale of his holding of Bank Stock (capital stock of the Bank of England). His bankruptcy gave great pleasure to the Stock Exchange, because during his governorship brokers had been barred from continuing to use the Bank’s premises as a market to conduct their business. He was in Russia as partner in the firm of Bury, Curtis and Kennedy of Liverpool, which had difficulties in adhering to its contract with the Russian government to supply cast iron immovable arches for the St. Petersburg–Moscow Railway. He died intestate and a bankrupt. His widow and children refused to apply for a grant of letters of administration to his estate. A receiver was therefore appointed by the court under the Bankruptcy Act in force at the time and a grant of letters of administration for Curtis’s estate was issued to that receiver. The document cites Curtis as a flax spinner late of Grandholm Works near Aberdeen in North Britain. He died at Woodstock in the County of Oxford. His effects were under £20 (W.

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-481"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-481-backlink">481</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has seemed that Eugenia Maria Reay, who married Benjamin Norman (12/23 November 1797 – 1836 or 1837) in St. Petersburg on 28 November / 10 December 1822 (PREC STP, no. 3234), is the Mrs. Norman intended here. We can ascertain Benjamin Norman’s death year from the baptism entry for his daughter, Mary, given as 30 July [/ 11 August] 1837. In this entry, he is called the <span class="CharOverride-1">late</span> Benjamin Norman, which means he had died within the previous 9–10 months. The widowed Mrs. Norman was described in 1845 as a dissenter living at the Dissenting Chapel (British and American Chapel) and engaged in the millinery trade (<span class="CharOverride-1">BRBC STP 1845</span>, fol. 42). She may have been living there earlier, which would account for why her daughter Emily was buried from the house of the pastor, John Croumbie Brown, in 1840. Mrs. Norman was very ill in 1842, according to Mary Tyler (Ropes) Gellibrand, who reported that Mrs. Norman’s little daughter was staying with the Gellibrands until her mother was better. The little daughter would have been Mary. (The letter, although dated only “August 17/29 from the Peterhoff Road,” had to have been written in 1842 because in it Mrs. Gellibrand speaks to her father of two events that took place in 1842: (1) the strife between Archibald Mirrielees and her brother, Joseph Samuel Ropes, that led to the severing of ties with William Ropes and Company by the former; (2) the birth of the Ellerbys’ daughter, Lucy).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">A thorough investigation of sources in England about the Norman family in Russia shows that there is no clue to where the family came from in Britain that might have led to further information about births and deaths missing from registers and Foreign Office correspondence and seeming therefore not to have taken place in Russia. For example, there is no burial entry for the above Benjamin Norman in any record of the two British churches in St. Petersburg, so he may have died away from this city.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Benjamin and Eugenia (Reay) Norman had four known children: William Joseph (c. 1824 – 22 July [/ 3 August] 1882), Emily (c. 1833 – St. Petersburg 11 June [/ 23 June] 1840), Caroline Steen (St. Petersburg 3 December [/ 15 December] 1834 – St. Petersburg 2 June [/ 14 June] 1838) and Mary (b. St. Petersburg 15 July [/ 27 July] 1837). It is quite likely that the Elizabeth Norman who married Karl Ferdinand Hensell in St. Petersburg in 1855 and the Benjamin Norman who married Ellen Margaret Brown in St. Petersburg in 1859 are further children of Benjamin and Eugenia (Reay) Norman born between 1823 and 1832. A witness at both weddings was William J. Norman, who may have been brother to these two Normans. He himself married in St. Petersburg in 1853 (his wife was Jessie Bartels). Elizabeth and Benjamin were not baptized in a British church in St. Petersburg and neither were William Joseph and Emily. It could be that these four children were all baptized in a non-conformist church in Britain, but a search for them in the IGI and in a central index to non-conformist baptisms has proven fruitless. The evidence suggests that Benjamin and Eugenia (Reay) Norman left St. Petersburg fairly soon after their marriage in 1822 and that they returned before the end of 1834.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The first 437 baptisms (1840–1872) and the first 513 burials (1840–1886) of the British and American Congregational Church in St. Petersburg are unknown, because the church transcripts (registers) are missing. This omission almost certainly accounts for some gaps in the biographical information about the Normans. For example, it probably explains why the death and burial of Eugenia (Reay) Norman cannot be known and why the baptisms of some of her grandchildren are not known. Moreover, as her son, William Joseph, and probable children, Elizabeth and Benjamin, were not married until the 1850s, it does not seem possible that she could have been a grandmother at this time.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">As a result, the Cadets who visited Mrs. Norman, their grandmother, cannot be identified, any more than can “the little Normans,” except possibly for Mary, Eugenia (Reay) Norman’s daughter, but we do not know her date of death.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The deceased Benjamin Norman had several siblings, including William (b. 10 May 1792 [OS]), Sarah (b. 10 November [OS] 1795) and Christiana (b. 27 August [OS] 1805). A wife of William could be a grandmother with cadet-aged children, but there is no record of his marriage because, after the registration of his birth, William disappeared from the records, along with his siblings.</p>

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-534"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-534-backlink">534</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several roads to the village of Krasnoe Selo (pronounced “Kras&#8242;nuhyuh Sillaw&#8242;”) (see <a href="images_14.html#image407" target="_blank">Image 407</a>). The name means “Beautiful, or, Red, Village.” The Krasnoe Selo Road to which Anna Whistler refers was a turnoff on the eleventh verst of the great Peterhof Road. Krasnoe Selo is located on an elevated spot formed by the Duderhof hills. At first glance, it resembles a district town rather than a village. It has a stone church named for the Holy Trinity and established during the reign of Catherine the Great, who had a summer palace built here. The palace on the Duderhof heights built by Nicholas&#160;I and resembling a large peasant hut is particularly remarkable. The peasants of Krasnoe Selo cultivate orchards on the slopes, which constitutes their main commercial endeavor. The Imperial Guard has encamped in Krasnoe Selo in summer since 1824. Their camp is usually set up on the slope of a hill opposite the village. At the foot of the hill is a rather extensive lake, while from the other side it is surrounded by brush and forest. The camp presents a charming picture. The cavalry usually sets itself up in the village, while the infantry camps in tents, which take up the entire space. The soldiers’ tents are set up in one line in three rows, at a certain distance. Behind and separated somewhat from them are the non-commissioned officers’ tents; then separated from them the staff officers’ tents; then the tent of the regimental commander, which is always in the midst of the regiment. The tents of the brigade commanders are in the midst of the brigade. Beyond them is the tent of the division general. Behind the tent of the regimental commander are placed the tents of his adjutants and, somewhat further off, tents for the chancery and musicians. In every regiment, in front of the battalions, at a distance of several sazhens, are the tents for the guards. All this gives Krasnoe Selo an unusual appearance and attracts the attention of the visitor (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburga</span> 1842, pp. 189-191; Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 192, 204, 312–313; Pyliaev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zabytoe proshloe</span> 1889, pp. 430–431); see also BUHG: Colin Ingersoll Journals, pt. 1, fols. 92–93.

Its construction was initiated by Catherine the Great in 1768 in memory of the birthday (30 May [OS]) of Peter the Great. The architect was Antonio Rinal’di (1709– 1794). The work, marked by frequent interruptions, was completed “for the time being” in brick by order of Paul I (see <a href="images_15.html#image417" target="_blank">Image 417</a>) in 1800 and given a temporary roof with a cupola. The foundation of the cathedral, which was built by the architect Auguste Monferrand (1786–1858), was laid on 26 June (OS) 1818. “When the cathedral is completed it will number among the most magnificent and richest religious edifices in the world. All of its inside walls will be robed in Russian and foreign marble. The capitals and bases of the columns are bronze covered with gold leaf.

Allan clearly also spoke of his picture, which he wished to show the emperor, for Orlov further responded, “He would view your picture with pleasure, if you would bring it with you next Sunday to Peterhof at 10 am.” The proposal was being made by the emperor on the understanding that transporting the painting to Peterhof would not harm it.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">On Sunday, 20 August / 1 September 1844, “at the conclusion of the liturgy His Majesty went to the Great Palace and received the report of the Minister of the Court, Prince Petr Mikhailovich Volkonskii (1776–1852), after which the latter presented Mr. Allan and his picture in the picture room” (RGIA: Fond 516, op. 28/1618, d. 153, 1844. Z<span class="CharOverride-1">hurnal Vysochaishego Dvora, po polovine Gosudaria Imperatora Nikolaia Pavlovicha</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Journal of the Imperial Court for the Apartments of His Majesty Emperor Nikolai Pavlovich</span> for 1844], fols. 434 r and v; this document is also known as<span class="CharOverride-1"> Kamer-fur’erskii zhurnal</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Chamberlain’s Journal</span>] and denoted hereafter as RGIA: <span class="CharOverride-1">Kamer-fur’erskii zhurnal</span>).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">One assumes that the picture Allan had with him was the partially completed painting of <span class="CharOverride-1">Peter the Great Teaching His Subjects the Art of Shipbuilding.</span> The painting was finished in 1845 in London and exhibited at the Royal Academy that same year. A reviewer said of it “the visitor is mocked full-face by … a piece characterless, feeble and unworthy of a place of distinction” (“Fine Arts: Royal Academy,” <span class="CharOverride-1">The Atheneum </span>(May 10, 1845): p. 466). The picture was then sent to St. Petersburg, and in his letter to Prince Volkonskii Allan requested the sum of £250 for it (Elizaveta Renne, “British Artists in Russia in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century,” in <span class="CharOverride-1">British Art Treasures from Russian Imperial Collections in the Hermitage</span>, ed. B. Allen and L. Dukelskaya<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>[New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996], p. 110). E. Renne is curator of British and Scandinavian Painting at the Hermitage.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Already in January 1846, however, when asked by the Chancellory of the Ministry of the Palace of the whereabouts of the picture, Frants Ivanovich Labenskii (1770–1849), the curator of the Hermitage, replied that “nothing is known to him of where it is now” (Renne, “British Artists,” p. 110). Continuing lack of knowledge of its location is reconfirmed in Renne’s article (Renne, p. 110).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The question has also been raised as to whether the picture ever arrived in St. Petersburg. Through their correspondence in 1971 with Larissa Dukelskaia of the Hermitage, David and Francina Irwin received information that it was “exhibited at the Royal Academy” and then “shipped to St. Petersburg, but there are no documents concerning its arrival, nor any trace of it having been hung in the Winter Palace” (David Irwin and Francina Irwin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Scottish Painters at Home and Abroad 1700-1900 </span>[London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1975], pp. 274, 436n85). There <span class="CharOverride-1">is,</span> however, a document concerning its arrival, although the title of the picture is not mentioned. The document is a letter to Allan from Charles Moberly, the Russia Company’s agent at St. Petersburg, dated 26 March 1846 (C. Moberly to Sir William Allan, St. Petersburg, March 26, 1846, NLS: Ms 6294, fols. 131r and v). Moberly had received a letter from Allan, obviously about payment for the picture. He had held on to the letter because the emperor was away and expected back soon, and, when Count Orlov returned, sent it to him. Moberly wrote: “The picture was in his Majesty’s cabinet, upon the Count’s asking if any return had been sent, the E. said that he did not know what you had written to Prince Volkonsky, for whom there was a letter waiting his return” (C. Moberly to Sir William Allan, St. Petersburg, March 26, 1846, NLS: Ms 6294, fol. 131r). A friend of Moberly’s who saw Count Orlov every day had written to Moberly: “He has informed me that the Emperor would make sure to tell him that he should give his department an order to make payment to Sir Allan of the price of his picture” (C. Moberly to Sir William Allan, St. Petersburg, March 26, 1846, NLS: Ms 6294, fol. 131r). Moberly expected that Allan would be hearing about payment from the Russian Mission in London soon (C. Moberly to Sir William Allan, St. Petersburg, March 26, 1846, NLS: Ms 6294<span class="CharOverride-1">,</span> fol. 131v). To date, it has not been possible to find a copy of a note about payment among documents from the Russian Mission in London at the Public Record Office. Count A.F. Orlov succeeded to the post of head of the Corps of Gendarmes and of the Third Section (Security Police) on the death of Benkendorf later in 1844.</p>

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">The departure of the Empress has been postponed by a very melancholy occurrence. The young and beautiful Grand Duchess Alexandra, whose betrothal and marriage I described in my letters last winter has gone into a sudden decline and her life is now despaired of. She was <span class="CharOverride-S">only</span> on the occasion of her marriage, remarkable both for health and beauty, and her loss will affect the spirits of the Imperial family very much.

			<p class="Endnote-text-after-quote">Nicholas&#160;I had departed St. Petersburg for England on 12/24 May 1844. Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna had been examined by Dr. Martin von Mandt, the emperor’s personal physician, on 15/27 May 1844, with a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The emperor had gone from England to Holland to visit his sister, Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna (1795–1865), consort of King Willem II (1792–1849). He arrived at The Hague on 10 June, where Mandt was waiting to inform him of the serious nature of his youngest daughter’s illness. The emperor left The Hague the following day for home (Oluf Lundt Bang, <span class="CharOverride-1">Livs Minder </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">Memories of Life</span>], ed. Vilhelm Maar [Copenhagen: Nyt Nordisk Farlag Arnold Busck, 1929], p. 245). I wish to thank Hanne Quillévéré of Victoria, British Columbia, for translating passages in Bang’s autobiography pertinent to the illness and death of Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna.</p>

She had been planning to foster his moral and spiritual development by reading Plutarch with him in the hope that the example of nobleminded husbands would help him (<span class="CharOverride-1">Son iunosti</span>, p. 160). Oluf Lundt Bang (1788–1877; see <a href="images_18.html#image485" target="_blank">Image 485</a>), the Danish physician who was brought in at the request of the Prince of Hesse-Kassel (see <a href="images_15.html#image435" target="_blank">Image 435</a>) to, hopefully, cure Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna, but who corroborated Mandt’s diagnosis, recorded the young couple’s predicament: The governess, Miss Higginbotham, “asked me one day if I couldn’t see to it that the Prince not spend the whole day reading novels aloud to his consort. I spoke to the Grand Duchess about this, and she confessed that it would be better if he had some diversions. This led to a conversation about husbands who have nothing to do, and she asked me to speak to the Emperor about it. The Emperor answered that the Grand Duchess would have to decide this together with her husband, who himself would like some freedom, but didn’t dare take it because of public (in Russia?) opinion. He could scarcely go riding for an hour or so before he was blamed for having left his sick wife” (Bang, <span class="CharOverride-1">Livs Minder</span>, p. 303).</span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">At four o’clock … we took droshkies and proceeded to town where we took the railroad cars for Tsarskoye Selo where we arrived about 6½ o’clock. The bride and groom with their attendants had taken an earlier train and were at the minister’s ready to receive us. Upon entering the house we were cordially welcomed by our worthy minister, Colonel Todd, and handed into a room where the wedding party assembled. We were introduced to company and after the usual compliments and salutations the ladies again became seated and the gentlemen all remained standing conversing with one another passing the compliments of the day. The ladies were all richly dressed, plain and nothing gaudy. In a few minutes it was whispered that the parson was in the adjoining room, when the servants entered and arranged for armchairs on one side of the room when the bridesmaid and groomman handed the conspicuous two to their seats and took the chairs on each side. All was quiet and for a few minutes we stood gazing in the face of the beautiful bride and admiring the neatness of the bridegroom, when the door of the adjoining apartment opened and the gentleman with the black robe entered with a solemn step and advanced to a table in the middle of the room. The company all rose and the interesting two with their attendants advanced to the table and the ceremony gone through with and all was pronounced okay!</p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation2">The groom then saluted his bride and salutations of all their families followed; we all then advanced and took the bride’s hand and wished her much joy but none of the gentlemen saluted her with a kiss. I thought this was not altogether right, for I felt as though I would like to have a smack at her. I accordingly walked quietly over to where she was seated and gave her one of the slickest kisses that she had had and told her that it was the fashion of our country for all hands to kiss the bride but I <span class="CharOverride-1">guessed</span> the rest of the gentlemen were too bashful. She smiled and put up her pretty little lips and such a smack you never heard.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation2">The wine was now brought in and we all drank the health of the bride and groom in German style, by touching our glasses together before drinking. Shortly after we got through with this, supper was announced and we proceeded to the dining room where we found a table beautifully set off. Everything was of the best, but all cold. We did not set down to the table. We stood around and were beautifully helped. Our glasses were all filled with good old Madasa [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>: Madeira] when we nodded and drank to each other. We had not, however, got fairly going; they were all entirely too quiet. The servants, however, soon brought in the champagne and I proposed a toast which livened them up considerably. Then another and another followed until we got on a pretty high horse and you may depend upon it; we celebrated both the wedding and the Fourth of July. The Emperor’s and the President’s health and the health of Mr. Eastwick and his family were drank with three cheers.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation2">We kept it going until near eleven oclock when we had to get ready for the last train of cars. We found we had not much time to spare but would have to be moving sharply or we should be left. Droshkies were ordered to the door where every man seemed to look out for himself. The bride and groom were the last or rather among the last to get into a carriage and the consequence was that they were too late. The train was just leaving as they reached the depot … I was fortunate enough to be on time. The party that was left, when they found that there was no help for them quietly drove back to Colonel Todd’s and kept it up nearly all night. I, however, was very glad that I got off or I should have been used up. Everything went off in fine style and all were highly gratified.

He had lost the sight of his left eye in an accident there and was forced to give up reading law because his right eye began to fail. After visiting his grandfather in the Azores, he returned home in 1817 and became a writer, a vocation his wealth enabled him to pursue despite his disability, because he could hire readers and research assistants. His first article appeared in 1821 in the <span class="CharOverride-1">North American Review.</span> From 1829 to 1836, he worked on the <span class="CharOverride-1">History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic,</span> which was published in 1838 and received praise from historians worldwide.

The <span class="CharOverride-1">History of the Reign of Philip II </span>(1855–58) was unfinished when Prescott died. “Prescott was more interested in action than in theory.

Its initial mandate “to spread the Bible only among the non-Orthodox inhabitants of the Empire” (Zacek, p. 414) was extended to include supplying Bibles to Russians as well (Zacek, p. 415). Eventually, “through the Holy Synod the [Orthodox] Church actively began to participate in the work of the Society” (Zacek, p. 415). In 1816, the RBS undertook “the first translation of the Holy Scriptures into modern Russian” (Zacek, p. 416). “The complete New Testament in modern Russian was … published … in 1821” (Zacek, p. 417), accompanied by the Church Slavonic text, which, however, could be understood by only a small portion of the population (p. 416). In 1822–1823 “a modern Russian New Testament without the parallel Slavonic text” appeared (Zacek, p. 417), making the edition less cumbersome in size and less heavy (thus easier for soldiers to carry with them) and cheaper (Zacek, pp. 417, 418). Within a short time, the RBS extended over all of Russia, becoming “an interdenominational union of all Christian faiths” and embracing all social classes (Zacek, p. 418).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">But it “had encountered … opposition from its very establishment” (p. 426) from individual Russians and from the Russian Orthodox Church. Eventually this opposition became political as well as ecclesiastical, and, although Alexander I refused for a long time to abolish the RBS, in 1824 he removed Prince Alexander Golitsyn as Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Instruction and abolished the Ministry itself, an act that placed “the affairs of the Orthodox Church once again under the separate administration of an autonomous Holy Synod” (Zacek, p. 431). Golitsyn, who had been President of the RBS since its establishment as the St. Petersburg Bible Society, resigned his post and was replaced by Metropolitan Serafim (Zacek, p. 432). The Orthodox clergy alone now had the right to engage in missionary activity and “to distribute the Scriptures which had been translated and published by the R.B.S.” (Zacek, p. 433). The Church also “called for an end to the translation of the Scriptures into modern Russian” (Zacek, p. 434). Alexander I refused (Zacek, p. 434). The RBS was identified by its enemies as being affiliated “with the now-suppressed Masons and English Methodists,” and it was said that “[the] principle of publishing Scriptures without note or comment” left the individual “to interpret Scriptures on his own,” “making him fall into heresy or indifference” (Zacek, p. 434). Arguments against the freedom to interpret the Scriptures were extended to the pernicous effect this had on the peasants, who had become disrespectful and even opposed to the Church (Zacek, p. 434). Alexander I continued to refuse to abolish the RBS (Zacek, p. 435). He died in November 1825, and his successor, Nicholas&#160;I, was not “interested in the fate of the R.B.S., whose operations by this time had all but ceased” (Zacek, p. 435). When the same arguments against the RBS were made to him, he acted and in April 1826 “commanded … [the] President of the Russian Bible Society to suspend all operations both of the central and local societies” (Zacek, p. 436). In 1831, the emperor sanctioned the establishment of “a new Protestant Bible Society in St. Petersburg,” whose “activities were strictly limited to the Protestant population” (Zacek, p. 436). Throughout his reign, “the higher Church administration continued to oppose the further translation of Scriptures into modern Russian” (Zacek, p. 436). Such a translation was not made until the reign of his son, Alexander II (Zacek, p. 436). This information about the Bible Society in Russia must have been related to Anna Whistler by her friends now active in the distribution of religious tracts: Mary and William Clarke Gellibrand, Joseph Samuel Ropes, Mary and Thomas Ellerby (see Note 577 below).

Her information must have come from Religious Tract Society members such as William Clarke Gellibrand, Joseph Samuel Ropes, and Rev. Thomas Scales Ellerby, some of whom sent communications to London that were quoted in the <span class="CharOverride-1">Annual Reports</span>. For example, the 44th report (<span class="CharOverride-1">Annual Report</span> for 1843) states that the “nobility are taking an interest in the religious welfare of their peasantry, and give to them many of the works which have been published” (p. 75). Pilgrims in the possession of tracts said they could “obtain a night’s lodging and food for a tract” (p. 75). Without tracts, they had “to pay … three times as much in money” (p. 75). Peasants who were literate read the tracts aloud to groups of other peasants in their villages (<span class="CharOverride-1">Annual Report</span> for 1849, p. 77). Superior officers of sailors were “happy of the favourable change” in those of their men who “read the Scriptures, and other good books” (p. 78– 79). Sometimes a group seeking tracts was so large that it “was impossible to go among them, for they would have thrown a man down”; therefore, the distributors tossed tracts to them from the windows of a house (p. 78). A similar episode with soldiers in the diaries threatened to call a halt to further distribution. Anna Whistler and her sons also pitched their tracts at some idle young men from a distance. The <span class="CharOverride-1">Annual Report</span> for 1844 contains an interesting account of enquiries for tracts made by soldiers going home on furlough or being discharged from the army, “so that the word of God [was] now being borne up and down in some hundred knapsacks, to the nearest as well as to the farthest governments” (pp. 79–81).</span></p>

The Barnes family lived in Springfield, Massachusetts, where the Whistlers had lived from 1838 to 1842. In his autobiography, the Barneses’ son, John Sanford Barnes, says that Deborah (Whistler) Haden “kept up a correspondence with [his] mother” until the latter’s death (John Sanford Barnes, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Egotistigraphy of a Rolling Stone, that Gathered Moss, Herein Scraped off for the Information and Amusement of His Family</span>, “privately published, edition limited to this one copy, New York, January 1, 1910,” p. 7, N-YHS).

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-589"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-589-backlink">589</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whistlers attended vespers at the Cathedral of the Lifegiving Trinity in the monastery, as Anna Whistler records seeing “a beautiful Altar peice … a painting of the Trinity.” The painting was executed by Karl Pavlovich Briullov (1799–1852; see <a href="images_7.html#image173" target="_blank">Image 173</a>) in 1840. The five-domed Trinity Cathedral, built by Rastrelli, was begun in 1756 and completed in 1760. The cathedral chapels were consecrated in 1761, the main church in 1763. The right chapel was consecrated in honor of the apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, and the left in honor of St. Zaccharias and St. Elizabeth. In 1840, after the renovation of the entire cathedral, the left chapel, which had been closed for several years, was consecrated anew, this time as the Chapel of the Beheading of St. John the Baptist. The monastery’s most important sacred object was kept in Trinity Cathedral in summer: the icon of St. Sergius of Radonezh, the Miracleworker. As a result, a large number of ardent pilgrims of all ages and classes would come almost every day in this season from St. Petersburg in veneration of the icon. According to legend, the icon was painted on the saint’s coffin board and brought here by the monastery’s founder from the Trinity-Sergius Monastery near Moscow. There is a cross on the icon with a piece of the holy relic of St. Sergius, given to the monastery by A.N. Muraviev (1792–1863), a famous traveler to holy places. The Cathedral was small – four and a half sazhens long and wide – and held only 600 people. Religous services were held in it only in summer, as it had no stoves (Pyliaev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zabytoe proshloe</span> 1889, pp. 197–198; Pyliaev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zabytoe proshloe </span>1994, p. 170; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburga</span> 1839, pt. 1, p. 154; Antonov and Kobak, <span class="CharOverride-1">Sviatyni Sankt-Peterburga</span>, vol. 1, pp. 54 –55).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The Briullov painting was still in the church around 1889 (the date of publication of Pyliaev’s book cited above). E. Atsarkina, who says in her 1963 monograph on Briullov that the painting is mentioned in Somov’s list and in the annual report of the Academy of Fine Arts for 1839–1840 by A.N. Mokritskii and V.V. Stasov, gives its location as “unknown” (Atsarkina, <span class="CharOverride-1">Briullov</span>, p. 356).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The icon-covered screen referred to is the iconostasis, which separates the nave from the sanctuary. The “gilded doors of the screen” are the Royal Doors, which “are constructed of two panels located at the center of the iconostasis, and connect the nave with the sanctuary. They are called ‘royal’ because it is believed that… Christ … is carried through them in the form of the eucharist. The symbolic meaning of the gates, and of all the images upon them, is closely associated with the perception of the sanctuary as an image of the spiritual world. This symbolism is apparent during the liturgy. The opening of the Royal Doors signifies the opening of the Heavenly Kingdom for believers. The closing of the doors reminds them of the eviction from the Garden of Eden after the Fall” (Roderick Grierson, ed.,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Gates of Mystery: The Art of Holy Russia</span> [Milan: Intercultura, 1993], p. 96). Only the officiating clergy may enter the sanctuary, where the liturgy is performed. The Annunciation is always depicted on the Royal Doors (the Archangel Gabriel on the left door, Mary on the right door), because it “is understood as the beginning of the Incarnation” (p. 96). Mary’s acceptance “of the news of her miraculous conception” is interpreted as being “a penance for the Fall of humanity” (p. 96). She is “the new Eve,” who “redeems the Fall of the first Eve and begins our return to union with God” (p. 96). Also depicted on these Royal Doors are the four Evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, “who brought the news of the life of Christ” (p. 98).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The “unknown tongue” of the service is Old Church Slavonic.</p>

The tavern has existed since the time of Peter the Great and has long been famous for its waffles. In winter, ice hills are constructed and enthusiasts of out-of-town excursions meet here. It was probably the first such place to cultivate gypsy choirs. On 26 December 1713 (OS), Peter the Great met Prince Romodanovskii here, and during the night of 28/29 June 1762 (OS), Catherine the Great, now <span class="CharOverride-1">head of the guards</span>, who had just sworn allegiance to her, rested here on her way to Peterhof. Casanova (1725–1798) revelled here in 1765. A ukase of 16 November 1706 (OS) announced that “perpetual hereditary ownership” of Krasnyi Kabachok was granted to an interpreter named Semyon Ivanov for his many services to the state, with the condition that it could not be sold or mortgaged. On 3 December 1748 (OS), Empress Elizabeth issued a further ukase concerning this privilege. The head of the police, General Vasilii Saltykov, had forced the children of the deceased Semyon Ivanov to sell him the tavern (1733), but a family member appealed to Empress Elizabeth, who ordered that the deed of sale be destroyed and the tavern be given to this family member with the right to sell it to whomever she wished. Krasnyi Kabachok then changed hands frequently, even being purchased in the 1780s by the Duchess of Kingston. In 1840, it was offered for rental as an inn, after being refurbished. In that decade, its fame began to decline. Its then illustrious proprietor was Louisa Grafemus Kessenikh (Cologne 1786 – St. Petersburg 30 October / 11 November 1852; buried in Volkov Lutheran Cemetery; see <a href="images_14.html#image408" target="_blank">Image 408</a>). The following advertisement placed by her in the newspaper <span class="CharOverride-1">Severnaia pchela </span>(<span class="CharOverride-1">The Northern Bee) </span>in 1846 reveals some of her amazing career: “The owner of the oldest of Russian out-of-town taverns, the woman-warrior Madame Kessenikh, who fought in the Prussian ranks (1813 and 1814) in the uniform of an Uhlan for the independence of Europe and received a decoration for it, invites you to the Krasnyi Kabachok. She settled in Russia a long time ago to be with her military comrades and serves the guests of the Krasnyi Kabachok in her winter quarters with excellent Russian bliny and German waffles. Foreigners fear Russian bliny as they would bullets, but for Madame Kessenikh bliny are blank cartridges and she regrets that she cannot introduce our national food to the Prussian forces. You simply must come visit the heroine of the famous war that replaced bivouac fires with the peaceful fire of the hearth. At Krasnyi Kabachok you will also find ice hills.” At the end of the 1850s, Krasnyi Kabachok burned down, and its name passed to another nearby inn (Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 313–314; Pyliaev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zabytoe proshloe</span> 1889, pp. 126–129; Stolpianskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergofskaia pershpektiva</span>, pp. 21–22, 66–67; Gorbatenko, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergofskaia doroga</span>, pp. 117–120; Petrovskaia, <span class="CharOverride-1">Kontsertnaia zhizn’ Peterburga</span>, pp. 86, 88, 89).</span></p>

From then on, every year for six weeks, the students lived in tents set up between the upper garden and the English garden at Peterhof. The village of Novaia, which had been located on this spot, was removed to a spot beyond Peterhof, in the direction of His Majesty’s personal dacha, and the area that had until then been arable land was in 1832 turned into a military field. The grand dukes endured the same hardships as the other students. When the summer field exercises, maneuvers, and Imperial inspection were over, the students had to storm the Samson cascades in the presence of the Imperial family. This they did at a signal from the emperor.

Colonel Todd, Maxwell, and Abraham Gibson, the Consul, thereupon conferred to see how the difficulties could be resolved without what looked to be a six-month delay.

In the reign of Catherine the Great, persons from distinguished and aristocratic families began to be buried here. The cemetery became the resting place of families such as Ol’denburg, Apraksin, Stroganov, Potemkin, Sheremetev, Zubov, Engel’gardt, Naryshkin, Opochinin, Golenishchev-Kutuzov, Razumovskii, Frederiks, and Stenbok-Fermor. Many of the grave monuments were considered works of art. In the nineteenth century, the cemetery became one of the most beautiful in Europe. Apparently, a list of some monuments from this destroyed cemetery may be found in the archive of the State Museum of City Sculpture in St. Petersburg. The museum itself contains salvaged cemetery monuments, but many thousands perished during the Soviet period (A.V.

Anna Whistler would have been affected by the monument, because she had lost “two little boys” to death. I inquired personally in July 2003 of Iurii Piriutko, a specialist on the city’s cemeteries and one of the authors of the aforementioned book, about the monument to the two children, but he could not identify it. </span></p>

Bennett, comp., <span class="CharOverride-1">Day Unto Day</span> [Boston: American Unitarian Association, 1873], GUL: Whistler Collection, W174). On the days corresponding to birthdays and deaths of loved ones, she commented on the person. The reference to James’s birthday and the comment are written next to the date “July 11”: “James Abbott MacNeill Whistler’s birthday, my first born son.” Moreover, James’s poem to his mother, while dated 10 July 1844, was presented to her on the 11th.</span></p>

James” (James Whistler to George Washington Whistler, [Peterhof Road, 11 July 1844], GUL: Whistler Collection, W652). MacDonald says the whereabouts of the drawing of the head of a Russian priest are unknown and dates James’s note “1842,” probably on the basis of its incorrect statement about James’s birth (MacDonald, <span class="CharOverride-1">Catalogue Raisonné</span>, p. 1)</span></p>

July 11th. 1844. My own darling James. You know not how those lines to your Mother touched her heart this morning! So full of the holy sentiment of a child’s affection and duty to her who ten years ago folded him with joy in a maternal embrace, dutiful and gentle” (Anna Whistler to James Whistler, Peterhoff Road, 11 July 1844, GUL: Whistler Collection, W351). On the envelope she wrote: “For my dear James on his tenth birthday. his Mother has nothing more to enclose than her <span class="CharOverride-1">Love</span>, and may the expression of his be exhibited in his life.” How intense and constant were her feelings on the subject is underscored by the fact that on 10 February 1878, when James was 43 years old and still leading a life she disapproved of, she returned his letter to him, after writing him a response of a kind that no one would like to receive, on the letter he had sent her almost thirty-four years before. It begins: “So may it be my precious Jamie! altho during the 34 years since you copied the verses, you have as often, let flatterers &amp; the love of Jamie usurp my place in your affections” (Anna Whistler to James Whistler, Hastings, 10 February 1878, GUL: Whistler Collection, W350).</span></p>

The tall column of water from the Samson fountain turns into a burning column and sparks scatter in the shapes of diamonds, rubies, and sapphires. Fiery peristyles hang over the canal. Further away majestically towers a colossal shield, shining like the sun, and proudly bearing in its center the name “Aleksandra” in fiery diamonds. Orchestras from the Guards regiments play in various locales of the gardens without cease, one replacing another, and the sounds of the music fusing with the noise of the water increase the enchantment. The Imperial family, accompanied by courtiers and foreign emissaries, moves about in wagons amidst the tightly packed crowd of merrymakers. The public carouses all night, leaving the garden only at dawn (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, pp. 21–38. Pushkarev’s description of these festivities is extracted from Bur’ianov’s extremely detailed description: Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburga</span> 1842, pp. 173–174).

Rolleston, “The Folklore of Pulmonary Tuberculosis,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Tubercule</span> 22 (1941): p. 57). There were “those who regarded the exhalations of cow houses as a sure remedy; no less a scientist than Joseph Priestly attributed the cure of his daughter to those fumes” (René Dubos and Jean Dubos,<span class="CharOverride-1"> The White Plague: Tuberculosis, Man, and Society</span> [New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1987], p. 136). “This practice apparently persisted through much of the nineteenth century. In <span class="CharOverride-1">La peau de chagrin</span>, Balzac speaks of a Swiss consumptive who cured himself by breathing in, extremely slowly, the ‘thick air of a cowhouse’” (Dubos and Dubos, p. 256). Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna was placed in the cowshed on the Imperial model farm in Tsarskoe Selo overnight, but could not endure the treatment. She was then placed in the small lodge, one of the three buildings making up the farm (see <a href="images_16.html#image458" target="_blank">Images 458–459</a>).

In January/February 1842, Benckendorff was made chairman of the Construction Commission, which was to direct and supervise the construction of the approved railway (the Commission was abolished later in the year, when the Department of Railways was created). Benckendorff’s home (No. 15) was located on the Fontanka River between Chain (<span class="CharOverride-1">Tsepnoi</span>) Bridge and Semionov Bridge, in the Second Ward of the Liteinaia District. As one walked along the Fontanka from his house towards the Grand Neva, the Summer Garden was visible on the other side of the Fontanka (P.S.

It contains several memorable things: the large clock said to have been bought by Peter the Great in Holland; the full-length portrait of Peter the Great in a cuirass and Danish uniform; various furniture purported to have been made by Peter the Great or used by him and by his daughter, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna. Built in 1711, the Summer Palace was intended as a summer residence and therefore an extensive garden was laid out around it (the present-day Summer Garden; see <a href="images_6.html#image149" target="_blank">Image 149</a>), in which popular festivities took place on Sundays. In 1725, a separate building with a salon for the festivities taking place in celebration of the marriage of Tsarevna Anna Petrovna (Peter’s daughter) to the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein was added to the Summer Palace. In 1731, this addition was destroyed and replaced with a wooden house in which Empress Anna Ioannovna lived, and later the Duke Biron (he was arrested here in the final days of his regency). In the reign of Empress Elizaveta Petrovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image413" target="_blank">Image 413</a>), the Summer Palace was restored to its original state, as it had been in the time of Peter the Great, and remains so to this day. In winter, the palace is closed; visitors are admitted only in spring and summer.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The Summer Garden occupies the entire area between the Grand Neva, the Fontanka, the Moika and Swan (<span class="CharOverride-1">Lebiazhii</span>) Canal. The Swan Canal separates it from the Tsarina’s Meadow, also called the Field of Mars. The Summer Garden is about 250 sazhens long and about 100 sazhens wide. At first, it occupied the area of the present-day Garden, and all of the Tsarina’s Meadow, which at that time was also planted with trees in the form of a park. The garden then also included land set aside for the Mikhail, or Engineers (<span class="CharOverride-1">Mikhailovskii,</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">Inzhenernyi</span>), Castle, and for the garden that now belongs to the Mikhail Palace (the Upper Summer Garden). The first plans proposed building the Summer Garden according to the rules of French horticulture of the time, with a grotto, covered avenues, and fountains and cascades, for which a water conduit from the Ligovskii Canal was built. These plans show the following structures: the Summer Palace, near Laundry Bridge; a grotto, in which in summer there is now a confectioner’s shop; a post house that was located on the spot where the Marble Palace stands and that was taken down in 1738; and the salon in which festivities took place (that is mentioned above in the information on the Summer Palace). This project was carried out. The garden had, in addition, a collection of rare birds and animals. It was decorated with lead statues depicting figures from Aesop’s fables and a large number of marble statues and busts from Italy. In the reign of Catherine the Great, the Summer Garden was embellished with new structures, such as fountains, cascades, statues, ponds, artificial hills, grottos, temples, and Chinese and Egyptian gazebos, but it suffered during the storm and flood that raged on 10 September (OS) 1777. The Garden was knocked down, and many trees were broken. They were raised and propped up. The iron clips holding the branches to the trunks were still visible in 1838, when Bur’ianov’s book appeared. The fountains destroyed by the storm had not been restored by that date. Particular attention must be drawn to the magnificent iron fence with granite posts, begun in 1778 and completed in 1784, which extends in front of the Garden on the Neva River side. It was built by the architect Iurii Matveevich Fel’ten (1730–1801), who was director of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. Its granite columns were cut from whole pieces, are two sazhens high with a diameter of three feet, and are placed on the same kind of pedestals six cubic feet thick. The fence has three gates decorated with gilded depictions of baskets of flowers, etc. The elegant design, quality of the materials, fine columns decorated at their summits with vases and urns, the bright gilt of the darts and rings all make the fence unique. In recent times, the furthest-lying avenues of the Garden have been turned into paved roads for horseback riding and phaeton driving. An elegant urn of Elfdahl porphyry, the gift of the King of Sweden, was placed in 1839 on the side where the Engineers Castle stands. From the very start, the Summer Garden was intended for the public and remains so today. Fashion draws the largest crowds here from Thomas Week (<span class="CharOverride-1">Fomina nedelia</span>) to Whit Monday (<span class="CharOverride-1">Dukhov den’</span>). On the latter holiday, there is a big celebration that in days gone by included the choosing of brides, especially by the merchant class. After that, the Summer Garden becomes the domain of people who spend the summer in the city and have no other place where they can enjoy the shade of trees. They can take advantage of the coffee house in the garden, the owner of which often hires musicians for Sunday performances. One may also enjoy the mineral waters in the Summer Garden instead of having to go to the main establishment in Novaia Derevnia, while outside the Summer Garden on the Neva in a charming two-storied moored house one may take the cure by means of steam and cold baths (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, pp. 262–266; Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 221–222, 334-335; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, pp. 662–663; Agapkina, <span class="CharOverride-1" lang="ar-SA">È</span><span class="CharOverride-1">ntsiklopedicheskii slovar’ A–Ia Slavianskaia mifologiia</span>, pp. 381–383).</p>

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-672"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-672-backlink">672</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “Circassian beauty” refers to an exoticized image of women from Circassia, in the North Caucasus. The reputation of Circassian women as extraordinarily beautiful and spirited, while still respectful and obedient, rendered them attractive commodities in the Turkish slave trade. This “historical image of idealized feminine aesthetics” also pervaded artistic, literary, and popular culture from “its initial appearance in the novels and theatrical plays of the seventeenth century” (Setenay Nil Doğan, “From National Humiliation to Difference: The Image of the Circassian Beauty in the Discourses of Circassian Diaspora Nationalists,” <span class="CharOverride-1">New Perspectives on Turkey</span>, 42 (2010): pp. 77, 82). In the 1800s, “this identification of the Circassian and Caucasian as the most perfect representatives of whiteness had taken hold of the public imagination” (Gregory Fried, “A Freakish Whiteness: The Circassian Lady and the Caucasian Fantasy,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Mirror of Race </span>[2013], online journal), and the term was used extensively to market beauty products in American and Europe. In 1843, “Circassian Hair Dye, for changing light, red, or grey hair to a beautiful brown or black,” was sold in Baltimore for one dollar a bottle (“Circassian Hair Dye,” Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, LC-DIG-pga-08523, advertisement flyer). While Anna Whistler would have ignored the association of Circassian beauty with concubines, she probably was aware of the beauty products and would have known the term from literary allusions. Known as the beautiful Mrs. Anderson, Anna Whistler’s acquaintance, Anne Elizabeth (Main) Anderson, had dark eyes, presumably dark hair, a sweetness of manner, and sang affectingly, the attributes of a Circassian maid.</span></p>

He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1832, then attended Andover Theological Seminary. “He applied for orders” in the Episcopal Church in 1834 and was confirmed in October of that year. In July 1835, “he was ordained deacon in Trinity Church, Boston … and soon afterwards was appointed by the Foreign Committee of the Board of Missions to make an investigation of the State of Mohammedanism in Turkey and Persia.” “On … returning to the United States he was ordained bishop in St. Paul’s Chapel, New York City, on October 3, 1839.” “He was appointed missionary to Constantinople in 1840, and served for four years in that capacity, during which time he made a tour through Mesopotamia.

On returning to the United States, “he offered his resignation, which was accepted by the house of bishops in October 1850.” “He received the degree of S.T.D. from Columbia [University] in 1845 and … from Trinity [College] in 1846.” “He was elected bishop of California in 1850 and of Ha[i]ti in 1870, but declined.” “In 1851 he went to Portland, Maine, and organized St. Luke’s Parish.” In 1852, “he accepted the rectorship of the Church of the Advent, Boston, which he held until the close of 1858.” “In the autumn of 1859 he became rector of Zion Church, New York City, … resigning in September 1872,” because of failing health. He then retired to Ravenswood, New York. He died on 12 April 1894 in Astoria, Long Island. He married in January 1839 Elizabeth Browne, who died in August 1850 and with whom he had six children.

He graduated from Columbia University at 16 and became a businessman. On 26 April 1821, he married Frances Maria Mulligan (see following Note). After twenty years in the business world, he entered the Protestant Episcopal Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia, and was ordained a priest in Norfolk in 1831. When in that same year his church established a foreign mission in Greece after the expulsion of the Turks, he volunteered for service and went with his wife to Athens, where they opened the first schools for boys and girls in the new Greek kingdom. The following year, the Greek government undertook the education of boys, and the Hills took upon themselves the education of girls and the training of teachers. In addition to operating a paying school called “Mrs. Hill’s Private Boarding and Day School for Children of the Higher Classes,” they also ran “The American School” in the Agora for the poor, free of charge. The quality of female education offered by the Hills caused their school to become a model for other schools in Greece, especially because they did not attempt to proselytize. Rather, “Dr. Hill never tried to disturb the religious beliefs of the Greek girls he taught, but took care most conscientiously to establish them, providing that they be taught the orthodox catechism by a worthy Greek cleric or theologian,” because he “saw that what Greece needed was simply education, and that the proselytism which aims at drawing away Greeks from their national faith, could only injure Greece, disturbing the bases of the religion of the nation … He reverenced the Eastern Church, as ancient, preserving the Christian traditions of the first ages, and fitted, if anything was lacking to her, in due time, when education of her clergy and laity was more advanced, to set things in order for herself.” Mr. Hill was also for thirty years the chaplain of the British Legation. He constantly refused offers of decorations from the Greek government, but in 1881, on the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of “The Girls’ School,” King George I sent him an official letter of thanks. In 1877, he became blind but continued his work with his wife’s help. His funeral was a public manifestation of sorrow, and he was accorded the honors given a grand commander (<span class="CharOverride-1">Dictionary of American Biography</span>, s.v. “Hill, John Henry”; <span class="CharOverride-1">Journal of the Proceedings of the Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Diocese of Virginia…Nineteenth…of May, 1831</span> [Richmond, 1831], pp. 12; <span class="CharOverride-1">The Churchman</span>, July 15, Aug. 5, 12, 26, 1882; <span class="CharOverride-1">The Church Eclectic</span>, Oct. 1882, pp. 627–9; <span class="CharOverride-1">New York Times</span>, July 9, 1882; <span class="CharOverride-1">New-York Evening Post</span>, April 27, 1821).

In 1838, he was minister at St. John’s Church, Cuyahoga Falls, Stow, Ohio; in 1839–1840, at Trinity Church, Newark, Ohio; in 1841, at Wakefield, Rhode Island (Wayne H.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">From 1841–1844, he was Rector of Christ’s Church in Westerly, Rhode Island, not far from Stonington, Connecticut. The latter did not have an Episcopal church, and the one in Westerly had not been long established. In 1833, the Rev. Erastus De Wolf preached at Westerly but “no church … was embodied.” In 1834, the Rev. John A. Clark “was instrumental in organizing” it. “It dates from November 24, 1834. The first pastor … was Rev. James Pratt.” In 1835, Christ’s Church was built, and in 1836 the parsonage. “[Rev.] Pratt officiated till December 26, 1839” and was succeeded by Rev. Newman (Frederic Denison, <span class="CharOverride-1">Westerly (Rhode Island) and Its Witnesses, for Two Hundred and Fifty Years 1626–1876</span> [Providence, RI: J.A. &amp; R.A.

On the basis of the recommendation made by the Commission for Building in St. Petersburg, in 1738 a new decree was issued by the Synod concerning “places where burials should take place.” In this decree, the future Smolensk Cemetery (Orthodox) near Black River (<span class="CharOverride-1">Chernaia rechka</span>) on Vasilievskii Island is mentioned for the first time. The ukase of 1756 brought into existence two of the most famous burial grounds of Old Petersburg, which still exist today, in the twenty-first century: the Smolensk and Volkov cemeteries. As regards the Smolensk Cemetery, the ukase of 1756 simply confirmed the already-established tradition of burial in the northwestern section of Vasilievskii Island near Chernaia rechka, between Lines 18 and 23. The wooden church here of the Smolensk Icon of the Mother of God was consecrated in the autumn of 1760. The cemetery was surrounded with a fence, and a trench for drying out the marshy site was dug from the western side. Chernaia rechka was also renamed after the Smolensk Church and called the Smolenka River. The delapidated wooden church was rebuilt in 1772 and consecrated as the Church of St. Michael the Archangel. In 1786–1788, on the site of two almshouses built in 1762, the Smolensk Temple (<span class="CharOverride-1">khram</span>), a stone edifice, was built. Although the Smolensk Cemetery suffered greatly during the catastrophic floods of 1777 and 1824, it continued to remain one of the important and famous cemeteries of St. Petersburg. Starting in the 1820s, pilgrimages began to be made here to the grave of Blessed Kseniia of Petersburg (canonized in 1988). Primarily inhabitants of Vasilievskii Island were buried in this cemetery, but frequently funeral processions made their way here from other parts of the city, too. Traditionally the intelligensia was buried here: university professors, academicians, artists, actors, writers. On the right bank of the Smolenka River, in the southern part of Golodai Island, there was from 1747 a cemetery for foreign inhabitants of St. Petersburg belonging to various faiths, of which Protestants made up the largest group. A significant number of the foreigners lived on Vasilievskii Island. The founding and history of the Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery is closely connected with the oldest Lutheran Church in St. Petersburg, that of St. Catherine. The cemetery was registered with this church, subordinated to its church council and intended above all for the non-Orthodox inhabitants of Vasilievskii Island. Since German Lutherans predominated among St. Petersburg’s foreign inhabitants, in the eighteenth century foreign cemeteries were most often called Lutheran or German, although Catholics (who until the mid-nineteenth century had no burial ground of their own), Anglican, Reformed, and other denominations were also buried here. This particular Lutheran cemetery acquired the name Smolensk Lutheran, or Evangelical, Cemetery after the Church of the Smolensk Icon of the Mother of God was built (1760) in the neighboring Orthodox cemetery. In 1791, an Armenian Cemetery was also established nearby (Kobak, <span class="CharOverride-1">Istoricheskie kladbishcha Peterburga</span>, pp. 22, 24, 25, 286, 288, 290, 309; Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 292–293; Antonov and Kobak, <span class="CharOverride-1">Sviatyni Sankt-Peterburga</span>, vol. 3, pp. 183–188). When Anna Whistler says their horses could not take them to the island where the Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery was located, she may have had in mind the distance, as they had to traverse Vasilievskii Island and then cross onto Golodai Island, and the fact that the road to the cemetery could be muddy.</span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-715"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-715-backlink">715</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna Whistler meant “Strel’na.” When one is going in the direction of Peterhof, Strel’na is next after the Trinity-Sergius Monastery and is located on the seventeenth verst of the Peterhof Road. An elevated spot on the shore was chosen by Peter the Great as a suitable place for quickly crossing the Gulf of Finland to Cronstadt. First a wooden palace was built here; then, in the teens of the eighteenth century, the construction of a stone staging palace, the closest of the Imperial palaces to St. Petersburg, was begun. The palace (see <a href="images_14.html#image398" target="_blank">Images 398–399</a>), its main façade facing the sea, stands on the crest of this elevation, which descends to the Lower Park in a series of three terraces. The proximity to the sea, the features of the natural relief of the shore, and the rich water resources of the area suggested great possibilities for the creation of a park with a system of canals and fountains. A system of horizontal and vertical canals and one circular canal, in the center of which stands a small island, emerges into the Gulf of Finland and also approaches the palace, making it possible to arrive at the palace by boat. A series of architects worked on the palace: Jean-Baptiste Leblond (1679–1719), N. Michetti (1675–1759), M.G. Zemtsov (1688–1743), T.N. Usov (1700–1728), A.N. Voronikhin (1759–1814), and L. Rusca (1758–1822). In 1722, Peter, who had lost interest in Strel’na, gave it and the unfinished palace to his daughter, Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna (1708–1728), as an engagement present. In the reign (1730–1740) of Anna Ioannovna (1693–1740), the palace burned down. Empress Elizaveta Petrovna (1709–1761; reigned 1740–1761; see <a href="images_15.html#image413" target="_blank">Image 413</a>) ordered it rebuilt according to plans by Rastrelli, but the Seven Years War interfered with its completion. It remained unfinished and in a state of neglect until 1797, when Paul I (see <a href="images_15.html#image417" target="_blank">Image 417</a>) gave Strel’na to his son, Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich (1779–1831), who set about having the palace restored and the park built. In the summer of 1800, he moved there, living first in the wooden palace and then in the west wing of the stone palace. In December 1803 /January 1804, the entire palace burned down again and, in 1804, was once more rebuilt. After this, the palace did not undergo changes for close to half a century. Strel’na was Konstantin Pavlovich’s favorite place in summer. After his death, it passed to his nephew, Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich (1827– 1892; see <a href="images_15.html#image436" target="_blank">Image 436</a>). In 1847, a new cycle of construction was begun (by A.I. Shtakenshneider [see <a href="images_8.html#image194" target="_blank">Image 194</a>] and others) that greatly changed the ensemble of buildings and grounds. The wooden palace was still standing when the Whistlers were in Russia (V. Ia.

The estate was the property of Aleksei Fyodorovich Orlov, who became head of the Corps of Gendarmes and of the Third Section (Security Police) on the death of Aleksandr Khristoforovich Benkendorf in 1844 (see AWPD, Part I, Note 636).</span></p>

What was then my astonishment to see the whole population from Tsarskoe Selo to the citadel (twenty versts) forming such a dense column that my horse could hardly walk through it. The sight of this multitude on their knees praying for us, and sharing in the deep silence the anguish of my soul, truly touched my heart.

When Aleksandra Nikolaevna first fell ill, she expressed the wish to see her “Miss.” Miss Higginbotham, whom she called “Miss Higg,” came to her “dear child” and remained with her to the end (<span class="CharOverride-1">Son iunosti</span>, pp. 163, 165). Sir Roderick Impey Murchison (see <a href="images_8.html#image192" target="_blank">Image 192</a>) wrote in his journal:</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">The Emperor was near his dear child when she made her last sign to him to approach her, when kissing her and putting his ear to her expiring voice, she said, “Papa, never forget the person to whom I owe everything.” This allusion was to Miss Higginbotham, the governess of this excellent and beautiful young princess, and no nobler trait of her character could she have left behind her. (Geikie, <span class="CharOverride-1">Life of Murchison</span>, vol. 2, p. 36)</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Miss Higginbotham was also held in great esteem by Nicholas&#160;I (Bang, <span class="CharOverride-1">Livs Minder</span>, p. 301), which may be one of the reasons why Dr. Martin Wilhelm von Mandt, his personal physician, disliked her (Bang, p. 247). It was Mandt who correctly diagnosed that Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna had tuberculosis instead of whooping cough, the diagnosis of the emperor’s previous personal physician, Dr. Georg Rauch (1780–1864), who was hard of hearing and therefore unable to use the stethoscope. She had been treated chiefly with baths, being kept in cold temperatures, and other forms of hardening on the initiative of Miss Higginbotham (Bang, p. 244). There were many clashes between Mandt and Miss Higginbotham. Dr. Oluf Lundt Bang (see <a href="images_18.html#image485" target="_blank">Image 485</a>), the Danish physician who was requested by Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel, husband of Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna, to come to St. Petersburg and treat her, confirmed Mandt’s diagnosis. He felt that Denmark would suffer a great loss in the death of Aleksandra Nikolaevna, who was known throughout the entire country for her goodness (Bang, p. 303). He also attributed the fact that she was equally cultured both emotionally and spiritually (“on the heart’s as well as on the spirit’s side”) to the influence of Miss Higginbotham (Bang, p. 303). An anecdote showing Miss Higginbotham’s sometimes-teaching-while-teasing relationship with Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna may be found in the memoirs of the wife of the director of the Imperial Chapel Choir, Elizaveta Nikolaevna L’vova (1788–1864) (“Rasskazy, zametki i anekdoty, iz zapisok Elizavety Nikolaevny L’vovoi” [“Stories, Notes, and Anecdotes from the Memoirs of Elizaveta Nikolaevna L’vova”], <span class="CharOverride-1">Russkaia starina</span> 28 [August 1880]: pp. 800–801). Miss Higginbotham visited Bang in Copenhagen later that year. The newspaper noted on 8 October 1844 that she had arrived on 6 October and had stayed at the Hotel d’Angleterre (Bang, p. 303). Presumably she came on the French steamship <span class="CharOverride-1">Amsterdam</span>, which docked in Copenhagen en route from St. Petersburg to Le Hâvre, and she may have journeyed on to England on the English steamship <span class="CharOverride-1">Mermaid</span>, which left Copenhagen for London on Wednesday, 9 October (Bang, p. 303). Her name ceases to appear in the <span class="CharOverride-1">Mesiatsoslov</span> as of 1845. On 2/14 September 1851, she and John Wilson, widower, were married by banns, according to the Rites of the Church of England by Rev. Dr. Edward Law (PREC STP, no. 6186, p. 416). Sophia (Higginbotham) Wilson died at the age of 56 years and eleven months on 1/13 July 1854 and was buried in the Smolensk Cemetery on 5/17 July 1854 (PREC STP, no. 6526, p. 473). See also O. Iu.

The brilliant era of Peterhof belongs to the reign of Nicholas&#160;I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>), whose permanent summer residence it became starting in 1832. New parks were added to already existing ones, thus enclosing the town in a green ring. The town was enlarged considerably and extensive new regions came into being, populated with private homes and dachas in classic, Swiss, Gothic and other styles, that were immersed in gardens. Peasant fields and the roads in the southern part of the area were given an orderly appearance and villages built anew (Gorbatenko, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergofskaia doroga</span>, pp. 234, 260). Anna Whistler’s selective description of Peterhof in this diary entry shows that they entered the main gates and walked through the Upper Garden at the back (south façade) of the Great Peterhof Palace. The palace is built with its front (north façade) at the edge of a natural terrace on the boundary of the Upper and Lower Gardens. This terrace towers almost sixteen meters above the Lower Garden. They then descended to the Lower Garden, with its grotto and fountains below the front of the palace, and went to the eastern part of this garden where they visited the bath house with its pool and Monplezir (Mon Plaisir) Palace on the Gulf of Finland. The gardens were filled with beautiful objects in the form of fountains, statues, bas reliefs, urns, cascades, and the Tsarina’s pavilion on an island in a pond. Anna Whistler did not record that they also visited the Hermitage (or, Other Monplezir), but other evidence in the diaries supports this.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-798"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-798-backlink">798</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;As one approached Peterhof, one would pass on the Peterhof Road the estates of Znamenka, Mikhailovka, the Private Dacha and Sergievka, all belonging to members of the Imperial family.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Znamenka was located between the Peterhof Road and the Gulf of Finland, more easternly than Alexandria. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, this territory belonged to A.D. Menshikov. After passing through the hands of several magnates, it was acquired in 1755 by Field Marshal General A.G. Razumovskii. It was then that it began to take on the features of a wealthy summer residence. In the 1790s, it passed from Razumovskii to Senator I.V. Miatlev and belonged to this family until 1835. Nicholas&#160;I bought it from the Miatlevs’ improverished heirs for a million rubles and presented it to his wife, just as he had Alexandria. It belonged to her at the time of the Whistlers’ stay in Russia.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Mikhailovka bordered on Znamenka on the west side. Here there were several estates, including one called “Favorite” belonging to Menshikov, which was preserved until the 1760s. In the 1830s, the three estates located here became the property of the Imperial family. It was decided to build a summer dacha here for the youngest son of Nicholas&#160;I, Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich, whence the name of the estate.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The Private Dacha is located three kilometers to the west of the Upper Garden of Peterhof. After 1727, and up until 1730, this was a seaside grange with a two-storied stone house belonging to Prince Aleksei Dolgorukii. In 1733–1736, it belonged to the famous publicist and orator, Archbishop Feofan Prokopovich. In 1741, it was presented to the future Empress Elizaveta Petrovna, and in her reign a large wooden palace was built here. This palace was dismantled in 1798–1801. In 1843, the Private Dacha was presented by Nicholas&#160;I to Grand Duke Aleksander Nikolaevich, the future Alexander II.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">On its west side, the Private Dacha borders on Sergievka, named for one of the magnates who owned it. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, it belonged to one of Peter the Great’s courtiers, A.I. Rumiantsev, from whom it passed to his son, Field Marshal P.A. Rumiantsev-Zadunaiskii. In 1822, the Rumiantsevs sold the grange to the Naryshkins. The Naryshkin dacha was acquired by order of Nicholas&#160;I for his daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna, on the occasion of her marriage to the Duke of Leuchtenberg, and came to be called the Leuchtenberg estate. From 1839 to 1842, the architect, A.I. Shtakenshneider (see <a href="images_8.html#image194" target="_blank">Image 194</a>), built a palace here resembling an Italian country villa, and in 1845–1846, a small chapel (A.G. Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets Dvortsy-muzei, parki, fontany</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets: Palace–Museums, Parks, and Fountains</span>] [Leningrad: Lenizdat, 1988], pp. 186–191; N.I.

Starting at these pylons, the Upper Garden is enclosed on three sides by a massive wall of stone pillars with reliefs of lion masks alternating with wooden spears. The wall has six gates. The pylons are decorated with paired Corinthian columns. The columns support a wide, detached (<span class="CharOverride-1">raskrepovannyi</span>) cornice and volute-shaped pedestals for sculptures. The massiveness of the pylons emphasizes the lightness of the tracery of the forged gates attached to them, which are simple and severe in style. Through the gates may be seen the terrace of the Upper Garden, a fifteen-hectare area in front of the south façade of the Great Peterhof Palace. These main gates were built in 1754 (N.I. Arkhipov and A.G. Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Peterhof</span>] [Leningrad and Moscow: Iskusstvo, 1961], pp. 153, 156.

The construction of a modest stone palace on the hill, was started in 1714 by order of Peter the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image411" target="_blank">Image 411</a>), under the supervision of the architect, Johann Braunstein. Ultimately, it became the centre section of the entire Great Peterhof Palace. In July 1746, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image413" target="_blank">Image 413</a>) requested the architect, Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, to build side wings of stone onto this main structure. Rastrelli submitted a general plan for the entire palace, in which the right wing connected with the palace church and the left wing with “the building under the coat of arms.” Rastrelli’s plan also proposed remodeling the center section of the palace so that the entire façade would have a uniform look. The remodeling was completed in 1754. Peter’s monogram remained in the center section, while Elizaveta Petrovna’s was placed on the wings. </span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The enlargement of the palace ultimately resulted in clearly defined structural masses on either side of a central structural mass and alternating in a certain rhythm. The central three-storied part of the palace is marked by an elegant high-figured roof crowned with a gilded vase with garlands of flowers and winged geniuses. This section is flanked on either side by symmetrical three-storied sections, each with a somewhat less high tent-style roof. Connected with the central part are the two basic and largest three-storied wings, which face onto the Upper Garden. In sharp contrast, next come the glassed-in arcades of single-storied galleries with balustrades. These culminate in the two-storied church building and the “building under the coat-of-arms.” The church has five gilded cupolas. The “building under the coat-of-arms” has a roof in the form of a four-sided cupola of white iron with gold decorations. A three-sided, three-headed Imperial eagle weathervane, two-and-a-half feet high and weighing 16 poods, was placed on the summit of this cupola in 1751 (a pood is the equivalent of 16.38 kilograms), but whichever way it turned, it seemed double-headed. The palace is 134 sazhens long and 8 sazhens wide. The exterior was painted yellow with white trim.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The first and third floors were for the retinue, the second contained luxurious rooms where at times members of foreign Imperial families were housed (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, pp. 86–88; Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets Dvortsy</span>-<span class="CharOverride-1">muzei, p. </span>5. For a different account, see N.G. Sharubin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ocherki Petergofa i ego okrestnostei </span>([<span class="CharOverride-1">Sketches of Peterhof and Its Environs</span>] [St. Petersburg: s.n., 1868], pp. 6–7). A description of the rooms and of many of the pictures to be found in them, including the famous Rotari (1707–1762) portrait gallery, was published by Geirot (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, pp. 88–93; see also Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets Dvortsy-muzei</span>, p. 63.) It does not seem, however, that the Whistlers ever saw the interior of the palace. In both diary entries about a visit to Peterhof (1844 and 1846), the family of Grand Duke Aleksandr Nikolaevich (see <a href="images_15.html#image425" target="_blank">Images 425–428</a>) was in residence, which precluded visits by tourists. Nor do extant Whistler family letters contain references to any visits by them to this palace.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The last large-scale changes to the Great Peterhof Palace were being made while the Whistlers were in Russia and were concluded after their departure. In 1845–1850, according to Shtakenshneider’s plans and under his direction, a third floor was being added above the eastern (garden) façade. The apartments of Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna (see <a href="images_15.html#image432" target="_blank">Image 432</a>), who was married in July 1846 to the Crown Prince of Würtemberg (see <a href="images_15.html#image433" target="_blank">Image 433</a>), were being remodeled (I.M. Gurevich, V.V. Znamenov, and E.G. Miasoedova, <span class="CharOverride-1">Bol’shoi Petergofskii dvorets </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">The Great Peterhof Palace</span>] [Leningrad: Lenizdat, 1979], p. 27; Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 93).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-801"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-801-backlink">801</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The water actually came from other sources. In 1868, Geirot explained the system. The water for the Peterhof fountains comes to Peterhof by means of two water-supply systems: an old one and a new one. The old has as its source the springs located in the villages of Elagino, Zaborod’e, Gladino, and Khabino. The new starts from the pond at the village of Levolovo; in the pond are combined the springs of the villages of Vil’puzi and Lapino. All of these villages are at a distance of approximately twenty to twenty-six versts from the Great Peterhof Palace. Halfway along the route, the two water-supply systems unite and from there on the water flows partly through a natural bed and partly through a man-made canal. At the village of Nizino (six versts from the Great Peterhof Palace) is the so-called Shinkarka sluice, by means of which in autumn and winter excess water is drawn off from Peterhof by the Strel’na River, and at that time, only the amount of water needed for replenishing the Peterhof ponds flows into them. The inhabitants of the town constantly use the water from these ponds for their own needs. In the summer, all the water from the Shinkarka sluice flows, first as a small river and then as an open canal, into the Tserkovnyi and Bab’egonskii ponds. At the latter pond, the water divides: one part of it goes to the Samson basin, which is the main reservoir of water for the fountains of the upper garden as well as for the Samson fountain and the Great Grotto. This basin is 300 sazhens long, 15 sazhens wide, and up to 3 sazhens deep. The other part of the water is directed from the Bab’egonskii pond into the ponds of the English garden and the ravine, and flows as well into the main water reservoir of the Peterhof Lapidary Works, i.e., the large reserve pond. Both systems supply water at the rate of 4,536 cubic feet per minute, or 75.6 cubic feet per second. When all the fountains are playing, the amount of water used per second amounts to 108.52 cubic feet (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, pp. 124–125; T.B. Dubiago, <span class="CharOverride-1">Russkie reguliarnye sady i parki </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">Russian Formal Gardens and Parks</span>]<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>[Leningrad: Gosudarstvennoe izdatel’stvo literatury po stroitel’stvu arkhitekture i stroitel’nym materialam, 1963], pp. 144–146; Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, pp. 159–164, 197). It is almost a commonplace among Russian authors of books on Peterhof to express their pride in the fact that the Peterhof fountains could play more frequently and longer than those at Versailles.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-802"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-802-backlink">802</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna Whistler is referring to the Great Cascade of the Great Grotto below the Great Peterhof Palace (see <a href="images_14.html#image400" target="_blank">Image 400</a>). Along the sides of the grotto are two cascades in the shape of gigantic staircases, each consisting of seven steps. These steps are decorated with sixteen gilded copies of ancient statues; vases, some purely decorative and others from which fountains gush; and twenty-four bas-reliefs. The entire grotto complex contains forty-one statues and twenty-nine bas-reliefs. Its chief effect comes from all the fountains playing at the same time. For a layout of the Great Cascade, see N.V. Vernova, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergof Bol’shoi Kaskad</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Peterhof: The Great Cascade</span>] (St. Petersburg: Gos. muzei-zapovednik Petergof–EGO, 1996), pp. 31, 103.</span></p>

It stands in a basin in front of the Great Cascade. From the basin a canal leads down to the Gulf of Finland.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">There is evidence to suggest that the Samson fountain was erected after 1725, that is, after the death of Peter the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image411" target="_blank">Image 411</a>), and that either Catherine&#160;I (see <a href="images_15.html#image412" target="_blank">Image 412</a>) had it put up no later than 1727 (the year of her death) or that it was put up in the reign of Anna Ioannovna, since no works were carried out in the reign of her predecessor, Peter II (1727–1730). There is also evidence that it was already in place in 1735 (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, pp. 18–19, 71).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">This largest fountain at Peterhof consists of the colossal nude figure of Samson, three meters high, standing on a pedestal made to look like a cliff, and tearing apart the jaws of a lion. The beast is standing on its hind paws with the claws of its front paws sunk into Samson’s left thigh. Out of the vanquished lion’s mouth shoots a seventy-foot-high jet of water, three inches in diameter, its spume spilling over the statue and pedestal. The jet had previously been one hundred feet high because the main Samson reservoir had been higher than the present one, but it is said that Empress Elizaveta Petrovna ordered the jet reduced because of the dampness caused in the palace by the spray in windy weather (Sharubin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ocherki Petergofa</span>, p. 15). Eight dolphins splash at Samson’s feet, and the half-figures of four lions, representing the four corners of the earth, look out of four semicircular niches in the granite pedestal. Streams of water flow from their mouths. The victory of Samson over the lion is an allegory of the victory of the Russians over the Swedes, of Peter the Great over Charles XII at the Battle of Poltava on 27 June (OS) 1709, the feast day of St. Samson. Young James Whistler was interested in Peter the Great and Charles XII through Hedenschoug, his father’s draftsman, but we do not know whether he was aware of the symbolism of Samson and the lion in its Russian context. He was most likely excited by the height of the Samson figure and of the jet of water. This gilded bronze group, the work of M.I. Kozlovskii (1753–1802), was installed in 1802 (Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, pp. 69–71). It replaced the original Samson group, made of gilded lead, executed by the sculptor, K. Rastrelli, in the 1730s (Sharubin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ocherki Petergofa</span>, p. 15; Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, p. 71; Vernova, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergof Bol’shoi Kaskad</span>, pp. 17–18). </p>

This is probably “the <span class="CharOverride-1">fencing</span> of some of the gilded figures with water” that diverted James.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-805"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-805-backlink">805</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The bath house was an indoor pool in a building with an open roof, built in the reign of Catherine the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image414" target="_blank">Image 414</a>). Built first in the eastern part of the Menagerie Pond, it was rebuilt in 1774–1776 according to plans by Fel’ten, this time over the entire pond. The fountain in the pond thus came to be located in the center of the pool (Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, p. 111), which was 50 sazhens long and 15 sazhens wide (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 80). The fountain was remodeled into a system where its freely pulsing jet was encased in a metal cylinder crowned by three interconnected gilded discs with over one hundred eighty small tubes along their edges. The discs and tubes were turned by a water wheel. When the fountain played, long sparkling jets of water like rays of sunlight flew from the discs, giving the ensemble the name “Sun” fountain. Around the fountain were four dolphins spurting jets of water from their mouths (Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvoret</span>, pp. 111–112). Geirot, in 1868, said the pool had retained its original appearance, despite having been repaired several times (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 80). He described it as “an elongated rectangular structure, which is decoratively painted on the outside so that this enormous structure in the middle of the garden will not seem heavy and will harmonize with its surroundings as much as possible” (Geirot, p. 80). It was also painted decoratively on the inside (Kurbatov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergof</span>, p. 80; E.

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-806"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-806-backlink">806</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The building Anna Whistler is referring to is Monplezir (Mon Plaisir), located in the eastern part of the Lower Garden (see <a href="images_14.html#image402" target="_blank">Image 402</a>). The name Monplezir also applies to the complex of auxiliary structures associated with this palace. Monplezir was the first palace Peter the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image411" target="_blank">Image 411</a>) ordered to be built in the eventual Peterhof complex (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 8). To save time on his frequent visits to the fortifications on Kotlin Island, he usually travelled via the south shore of the Gulf of Finland. At the spot most convenient for crossing to Kotlin Island, a small landing had been constructed and nearby two buildings for stopovers. It was on the shore not far from these two buildings that he ordered the small brick staging palace, some say in Dutch style, to be built (Geirot, pp. 7–8; Kurbatov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergof</span>, p. 47). Its construction was begun in 1714 and completed in 1724 (Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, pp. 94, 99). It consisted of a square central building with a spacious tiered mansard roof crowned with a large carved vase. A gallery was attached to the east and west sides of this building. At the end of each gallery was a small pavilion, also with a tent roof and with a smaller vase (G.N. Goldovskii and V.V. Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir v nizhnem parke Petrodvortsa </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">The Palace of Monplezir in the Lower Garden of Petrodvorets</span>], 2nd ed. [Leningrad: Lenizdat, 1981], pp. 4, 11; Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, p. 99; Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets Dvortsy-muzei</span>, p. 129). The central building consisted of a large main hall with three rooms each on the east and west sides (Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, p. 6). With its view of the Gulf of Finland, it became the favorite summer residence of Peter the Great (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 27; Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, pp. 10–11; Sharubin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ocherki Petergofa</span>, p. 19). When he came to Peterhof, he would usually sleep at Monplezir (Sharubin, p. 19; Kurbatov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergof</span>, p. 55). The sea air, he said, cured him better than any medicine; the architecture reminded him of his days spent in Holland (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 27; Sharubin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ocherki Petergofa</span>, p. 8). At the end of the first quarter of the eighteenth century, service wings were built. These elongated, adjoining single-story buildings were connected to the palace by small stone arches. They contained a dining room, pantries, rooms for the retinue, and the bathroom and bath of Peter the Great (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 75; Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, p. 99). Further off to the east were a bathhouse and kitchens, built in 1726 by order of Catherine&#160;I (Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, p. 10). These outlying buildings were subjected to many more changes than the palace itself. An especially large number of the changes were made in the reign of their daughter, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna. In 1748, she had Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli remodel the modest kitchens into an Assembly Hall, its walls decorated with tapestries woven at the Imperial tapestry works founded by her father (Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, p. 12). This is just one kind of change made by the daughters of Peter the Great to which Anna Whistler is alluding. Catherine the Great had the wooden terrace in front of Monplezir replaced by a marble one and the wooden balustrade along the shore replaced by one of pudozh stone (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, pp. 40, 76). Monplezir underwent major repairs several times: after the flood of 1770; in 1802, after a severe storm that had occurred in November 1801; and, for the third time, in 1825, after the famous flood of 7/19 November 1824; but it was never remodeled and changed. It was left looking as it had in the reign of Peter the Great and became a relic of his life (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, pp. 76–77; Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, p. 99).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The central part of Monplezir consists of a large main hall with a tent-shaped ceiling decorated with paintings of the four elements and with stucco moldings of allegorical figures depicting the four seasons. Apollo and four characters of the Commedia dell’ Arte are depicted in the painted plafond. The walls are panelled with dark oak, and the floor is of black and white checkered marble (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 77; Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, p. 36; V.N. Gusarov, N.V. Vernova, and V.V. Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergof v akvareliakh Aleksandra Benua</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Peterhof in the Watercolours of Alexander Benois</span>] [St. Petersburg: Art of Russia, 1996], p. 42). The north side of the hall faces the terrace and the sea, the south side the garden. There are three rooms each on the east and west sides of the hall. On the east side in Peter’s time were the Chinese (or Japanese) room, the kitchen, and the pantry. Nicholas&#160;I ordered that the pantry, a small room with windows looking out upon the seashore, be called the bedroom of Peter the Great. It already bore this designation when the Whistlers visited Monplezir and retained it until World War II. Here, the bed, bed linen, dressing gown, slippers, and nightcap of Peter the Great were carefully preserved (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 77; Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, pp. 49, 53, 58–60). The kitchen had blue and white Dutch tiles on its walls, a stone-tiled floor, a huge stove with trivets, and dishes and cooking utensils from Peter’s time (Goldovskii and Znamenov, pp. 44–49). The Chinese (or Japanese) cabinet was lined with black lacquered panels, to which were attached little gilded wooden shelves holding Chinese (or Japanese) porcelain (Goldovskii and Znamenov, pp. 28–36; Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, p. 93; M. Izmailov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Monplezir, Marly i Èrmitazh (dvorets i pavil’ony Petra I)</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Monplezir, Marli and the Hermitage: The Palace and Pavilions of Peter I</span>]<span class="CharOverride-1">, </span>3rd ed. [Moscow, Leningrad: Gos.izd-vo izobrazitel’nykh iskusstv, 1933], pp. 28–30; “Dvorets ‘Monplezir’” [“‘Monplezir’ Palace”], <span class="CharOverride-1">Khudozhestvennye sokrovishcha Rossii</span> 7–8 (1902): p. 206). On the west side of the hall in Peter’s time were the secretary’s room for his duty officer, the bedroom, and the Sea study, so called because of its view. When the Whistlers viewed these rooms, and up until World War II, the bedroom was called the study and the Sea study was called the reception room (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 77; Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, pp. 53, 56–58; Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, p. 92). The pavilions, galleries, Chinese (or Japanese) room, and secretary’s room were located on a single axis and made up the enfilade of public or reception rooms (Arkhipov and Raskin, p. 92). The walls of almost all the rooms and of the galleries and pavilions were covered with Dutch and Flemish paintings bought at auction in Holland personally by Peter the Great and through his agents (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, pp. 13, 27, 78; Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, p. 96; Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, pp. 20–28, 41–43, 70–87 and passim). This was the first picture gallery of its time in Russia (see following Note). The ceilings of almost all of these rooms were decorated, like that of the main hall, with an allegorical scene and sculpted plaster. On the south side of Monplezir, between the wings, was a beautiful shady garden containing some oaks and cedars planted by Peter the Great himself (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p.78). It is divided by two avenues in the shape of a cross into four parterre squares. In the center of the garden is the “Sheaf” fountain, called the “Crown” fountain in the period when the Whistlers were visiting. In each of the parterre squares there is a flowerbed with a symmetrical design. The “Crown” fountain emerges from a pedestal of limestone tufa. Its central vertical jet shoots to a height of twenty feet, and it has around it two rows of sloping fountains, one higher than the other. The water from the fountain falls into a circular basin and pours out of it from five marble spillways, and then into pipes, which empty into the sea. In the center of each square of the garden is a “Bell” fountain, each of which is a copy and is decorated with a bronze figure, representing <span class="CharOverride-1">Apollino,</span> Jacopo Sansovino’s (1486–1570) <span class="CharOverride-1">Bacchus</span> and Canova’s (1757–1822) <span class="CharOverride-1">Psyche</span> and <span class="CharOverride-1">Faun with Baby Goat</span>, all of which were cast in 1817. From the mushroom-shaped tops of the pedestals on which these four statues stand, water flows forming a glass-like cloche around the pedestal (Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, pp. 105, 108). The garden contains hidden “trick” fountains, some located in benches, that suddenly and unexpectedly turn on, wetting the unwary visitor (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 78; Arkhipov and Raskin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petrodvorets</span>, pp. 112–114). The side of the house facing the garden had windows down to the floor and struck some viewers as resembling a conservatory rather than a dwelling (Izmailov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Monplezir</span>, p. 10). The side facing the sea was more interesting: red brick walls with white seams between the bricks; windows with shutters; the high, tiered roof. The terrace here was also of brick, with a stone balustrade, the landing beyond the balustrade covered in marble tiles (Izmailov, pp. 10–12, 13). The view from the terrace was of the city, the sea, Cronstadt, and the northern shore of the Gulf: “to the right, when the weather is clear, glitter the spire of the Peter and Paul Fortress and the dome of St. Isaac’s Cathedral, and on the opposite wooded Vyborg shore, in the dark oak foliage, can be seen the white country palace built by Peter I and called by him ‘The Oaks’ … ; to the left menacing Cronstadt with its forest of masts towers above the sea; the view of the water and the ceaseless lapping of the waves complete the feeling of enchantment” (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 76).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Monplezir, with its view of the sea, shady garden, and flower-covered parterre with magnificent fountains, was one of the favorite and most frequented spots at Peterhof. Emperor Nicholas&#160;I, out of respect for the memory of his great ancestor, would, when at Peterhof, go every morning at eight from his residence, Alexandria, to visit Monplezir, from where he would then walk to the Great Peterhof Palace to his day’s work in the study of Peter the Great (Geirot, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Petergofa</span>, p. 79; Izmailov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Monplezir</span>, pp. 43–44; <span class="CharOverride-1">Son iunosti</span>, p. 26). A particularly charming commentary on Monplezir is to be found in Kurbatov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Petergof</span>, pp. 46–55.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-807"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-807-backlink">807</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Monplezir housed the first major picture gallery in Russia and one of the first collections in Russia of the works of Western European artists, predominantly seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Dutch and Flemish. </span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Up until 1980, the identification of the “fine pictures” at Monplezir that Anna Whistler mentions would have been almost impossible. An inventory of the collection had been made in 1728, three years after Peter the Great’s death, but it was for the most part vague in that it did not give the artists’ names or subjects of most of the pictures, which then numbered two hundred and four (Stählin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zapiski</span>, vol. 2, pp. 5–6). This was rectified somewhat by the inventory of 1746–1747, in which seventeen of the pictures now in the museum were identified (Stählin, p. 6). In 1980, however, some other very important eighteenth-century inventories were published. An article appeared entitled “Opisaniia imperatorskikh zhivopisnykh kollektsii v Peterburge i zagorodnykh dvortsakh, sostavlennye Iakobom Shtelinym” [“Descriptions of the Imperial Picture Collections in Petersburg and in the Outlying Palaces, Compiled by Jacob Stählin”], <span class="CharOverride-1">Muzei</span> 1 (1980): pp. 173– 193), written by the art historian K.M. Malinovskii. (The article was extracted from Malinovskii’s forthcoming two-volume work on Stählin – <span class="CharOverride-1">Zapiski Iakoba Shtelina ob iziashchnykh iskusstvakh v Rossii </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">Jacob Stählin’s Notes on the Fine Arts in Russia</span>], noted above – which appeared in 1990<span class="CharOverride-1">.</span> Stählin’s notes are translated by Malinovskii from German, and the volumes are equipped with an introductory essay and commentary.) Malinovskii published the detailed inventories of the art collections of the Imperial palaces of St. Petersburg and its environs compiled in the eighteenth century over a period of forty years by Jacob Stählin (Memmingen, Schwabia 9 May 1709 – St. Petersburg 25 June [OS] 1785) (Stählin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zapiski</span>, vol. 1, pp. 7, 22), who came to Russia at the age of twenty six, with a university education, experience as a poet–translator, and a knowledge of ancient and modern languages, music, allegory, numismatics, and fine arts, to be a professor at the Academy of Sciences. His work in the arts began when he was put in charge of the Engraving Department of the Academy of Sciences in 1738. At this time, he made his first descriptions of Imperial art collections, including Monplezir. In 1742, he left his work at the Academy of Sciences and became tutor to the Heir to the Throne. For forty years, he designed the firework displays and illuminations for the Imperial Court, one of the original purposes for which he had been invited to Russia. His closeness to the court opened the doors for him to St. Petersburg high society, resulting in his amazing knowledgeability about the private collections of St. Petersburg and the decor of these homes. His famous published work was <span class="CharOverride-1">Podlinnye anekdoty o Petre Velikom </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">True Anecdotes about Peter the Great</span>] (Leipzig, 1785). He lived in Russia for fifty years, dividing his activities among the academic, art, and court worlds. His notes about the fine arts in Russia are considered the first experiment at creating a history of Russian art. They include information on painting, sculpture, architecture, engraving, mosaics, tapestries, fireworks and illuminations, the art of medal-making, theater, music, ballet and dance art, as well as the history of picture collecting in Russia and the description of all the important Imperial and many private art collections.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The inventories for the picture collections of Monplezir, the Hermitage, and Marly at Peterhof were compiled in 1738–1739 by Stählin and the Swiss artist George Gsell (1675–1740), who had been a broker of pictures in Amsterdam when Peter the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image411" target="_blank">Image 411</a>) was buying them, and had come to Russia at his invitation (Stählin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zapiski,</span> vol. 2, pp. 5, 11). The collection of Monplezir in their inventory at that point numbered one hundred and eighty pictures (Stählin, p. 6). In most instances, partly because of Gsell’s previously acquired expertise, Stählin not only gives the name of the artist but also precisely identifies the subject, and in describing the picture stresses details that make it possible to recognize the picture even today (Stählin, pp. 5, 11) The Monplezir inventory, almost exhaustive in its completeness, increased the number of identifiable pictures in Monplezir to seventy three, while work accomplished by the late 1980s in searching for the pictures catalogued by Stählin made it possible then to view more than half of the original Monplezir collection (Stählin, p. 6). Of this original collection, ten pictures are now in the collection of the palace-museums and parks of Petrodvorets (the Russian translation equivalent of “Peterhof” used since 1944), three are displayed at the Great Peterhof Palace, one is in Marly, and nineteen are in the Hermitage (Stählin, pp. 6, 61–71). Stählin’s inventory was also used extensively in preparing a new catalogue (1st ed., 1976), of the one hundred forty-seven pictures in Monplezir in the 1970s (Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, pp. 70–87).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">We cannot say that in 1844 the Whistlers saw at Monplezir all the paintings Stählin described in 1738–1739. In August 1745, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image413" target="_blank">Image 413</a>) had ordered Lucas Pfandzelt (1716–1788) to remove some pictures from Monplezir to Petersburg (Stählin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zapiski,</span> vol. 2, pp. 61, 62). Other pictures, which were considered impossible to repair, had been placed in storage in 1747 (Stählin, p. 63). According to the inventory of 1797, compiled by order of Paul I (see <a href="images_15.html#image417" target="_blank">Image 417</a>) for all the Imperial palaces, there were then one hundred seventy-three pictures in Monplezir (Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>, p. 23). The flood of 1824 caused great damage to the picture gallery of Monplezir: thirty-five pictures were badly damaged and suffered as well from a poor job of restoration (Goldovskii and Znamenov, p. 23). My registered letter of inquiry addressed to Goldovskii and Znamenov concerning further inventories of Monplezir up through 1844 went unanswered. A positive note, however, is that of the thirty pictures transferred from Monplezir to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, most were not transferred until 1882 (Goldovskii and Znamenov, p. 69). Some of Stählin’s attributions and subjects have been shown to be incorrect, but this does not change what the Whistlers saw, only what they thought it was, if they were told at all. By comparing Stählin’s inventory with the paintings still at Monplezir in the 1970s, we can get an idea of some of what they might have seen (in the following list, S = Stählin, <span class="CharOverride-1">Zapiski</span>, and G/Z = Goldovskii and Znamenov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dvorets Monplezir</span>): Adam Silo (1674–1760): <span class="CharOverride-1">Ships on a Roadstead</span> (G/Z, p. 81, no. 96) and <span class="CharOverride-1">City Roadstead</span> (S: pp. 17, 18, 65, nos. 54, 57; G/Z: p. 82, no. 106); Willem van de Velde the Younger (1633–1707): <span class="CharOverride-1">Ships on a Calm Roadstead</span> (S: pp. 28, 30, 69, no. 136; G/ Z: p. 73, no. 24); Andries van der Horn (1600–1679): <span class="CharOverride-1">Boat Landing</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">View of a Canal in Saardam</span>)<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>(S: pp. 26, 27, 69, no. 128; G/Z: p. 73, no. 27); Jan van Huchtenburg (1647–1733): <span class="CharOverride-1">Horse Fair in Italy with Roman Ruins</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">Horse Fair</span> (S: pp. 27, 68, no. 123; G/Z: p. 74, no. 35); in the manner of Roelant Savery (c. 1576–1639), but attributed today to Jan van Kessel (1626 – c. 1679): <span class="CharOverride-1">Orpheus with Many Animals</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">Orpheus Taming the Animals</span> (S: pp. 25, 68, no. 123; G/Z: p. 75, no. 39); Adriaen van Salm (1660–1720): two marine paintings, one called <span class="CharOverride-1">Amsterdam Roadstead</span> (S: pp. 22, 23, 67, no. 93 or 94; G/Z: p. 77, no. 60); Gillis de Winter (1656–1720): <span class="CharOverride-1">Dutch Town</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">Landscape with Country Church</span> (S: pp. 18, 21, 67, no. 86; G/Z: p. 77, no. 55); Pieter Casteels III (1684–1749): <span class="CharOverride-1">Vase of Flowers</span> (S: pp. 19, 65, no. 60; G/Z: p. 82, no. 101); Abraham Storck (c. 1635 – c. 1710): <span class="CharOverride-1">City Wharf</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">Seaport with a Church on the Shore</span> (S: pp. 18, 20, 66, no. 71; G/Z: p. 82, no. 104); Rombout van Troyen (c. 1605– 1656): 2 paintings: <span class="CharOverride-1">The Destruction of Sodom</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">Lot Fleeing from Sodom</span> and <span class="CharOverride-1">Aeneas Fleeing from Troy</span> (attributed today to Daniel van Heil (1604–1662) (S: pp. 15, 63, nos. 26, 27; G/Z: p. 85, nos. 130, 131); Jan van Balen (1611–1654): <span class="CharOverride-1">Pallas Athena and the Muses</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">The Nine Muses on Parnassus</span> (S: pp. 30, 31, 70, no. 165; G/Z: p. 85, no. 132); Richard Brakenburg (1650–1702): <span class="CharOverride-1">Christ and His Pupils at Emmaus</span> or <span class="CharOverride-1">Supper at Emmaus</span> (S: pp. 23, 67, no. 95; G/Z: p. 79, no. 70); Karel Breydel (1678–1733): 2 battle scenes: <span class="CharOverride-1">Cavalry Battle</span> and <span class="CharOverride-1">End of the Battle</span> (S: pp. 17, 65, nos. 58, 59; G/Z: p. 82, nos. 98, 99); Adriaen van der Werff (1659–1722): <span class="CharOverride-1">Vertumnus and Pomona</span> (S: pp. 13, 62, no. 17; G/Z: p. 87, no. 146). Outstanding works by several famous painters listed by Stählin were transferred to the Hermitage in 1882. They include Jan Steen (1626–1679): <span class="CharOverride-1">Young Man Who Has Gotten a Servant Girl Pregnant</span> (known today as <span class="CharOverride-1">The Marriage Contract</span>) (S: pp. 27, 30, 69, no. 133); Joos de Momper (1564–1635): <span class="CharOverride-1">Hermitage with Hermits</span> (S: pp. 31, 70, no. 169); Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn (1606–1669): <span class="CharOverride-1">The Reconciliation of Jacob and Esau</span> (known today as <span class="CharOverride-1">David and Jonathan</span>) (S: pp. 21, 22, 66–67, no. 85).</p>

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-808"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-808-backlink">808</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this passage, Anna Whistler seems to be discussing a visit solely to Monplezir (see <a href="images_14.html#image402" target="_blank">Image 402</a>), and therefore seems to refer to paintings in it executed by Peter the Great himself. Fettyplace’s journal, however, makes it clear that it was the Hermitage at Peterhof (see <a href="images_14.html#image403" target="_blank">Image 403</a>) that was “adorned with … many rough specimens of Paintings by the great monarch” (entry of Sunday 30th July 1848, PEM: Fettyplace Journal; Fettyplace visited Peterhof on Friday, 28 July 1848). This means that Anna Whistler and the boys visited the Hermitage as well as Monplezir. This building was intended to complement Monplezir, as its earliest name – the Small, or other Monplezir – implies. Its construction was begun in the summer of 1721, and the decoration of the interiors finished after Peter the Great’s death. After some changes made to it in the 1740s and 1750s, which included covering the walls of the upper salon on the second floor with paintings hung in trellis fashion and replacing a lifting chair by a staircase at the end of the eighteenth century, no major changes were made to the Hermitage for the next two hundred years (<span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury prigorodov Leningrada</span>, p. 422).

Peter is depicted as a hero full of majesty, dressed in Roman armor, presenting an olive branch to a Russia worshipping on its knees before him. All around are the figures of abundance, trade, and the arts and sciences. The relief was executed by the German sculptor Johann Georg Österreich, in the reign of Catherine the Great, who liked to demonstrate her obeisance before the genius of Peter the Great and her own role as the continuer of his legacy (Izmailov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Monplezir</span>, pp. 17–18). But Anna Whistler records that she saw an ivory carving of Catherine&#160;I and Peter the Great. According to a catalogue published in 1966, an exhibit in that year in the Gallery of Peter the Great in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg included a rectangular ivory panel with a relief depicting the coronation of Catherine&#160;I (see <a href="images_14.html#image401" target="_blank">Image 401</a>). At the left, Peter the Great, standing under a baldachine, places the crown on the head of Catherine&#160;I, who stands at the right. Above is the inscription “1724 Crowned in Moscow” (V.N.

It sounds as if this is the panel Anna Whistler saw, but perhaps in another building at Peterhof. Objects connected with Peter the Great were also found in Marly Palace.</span></p>

Neither Elizabeth nor Maria seems to have married in Russia, and only Constantia/Constance died there with their maiden surname. Thus, because she seems to have made a life in Russia, she may be the Miss Forrester of Anna Whistler’s diaries. For more information about the Forrester family see Anthony G.

Whichever one of the misses Forrester is the Miss Forrester of Anna Whistler’s diaries, she could have male and female cousins with a variety of surnames, if one or both of her parents had siblings; moreover, the child aged four in 1844 could have been born outside Russia. However, a search was made for children baptised in St. Petersburg who were born around 25 August 1840 (the date being discussed in the diary entry of 26 August 1844), the date of the celebration of their birth (i.e., not necessarily their birthday). A very good candidate for the child whose birthday was being celebrated on the 25th is Henry Main Anderson, the son of Matthew Anderson and Anne Elizabeth (Main) Anderson, who was born on 13/25 August 1840. Matthew Anderson and Anne Elizabeth Main were married on 13/25 July 1838. Henry Main appears to be their first child. They also had a daughter named Minna, who was born on 2/14 November 1842 and died 9/21 April 1843. Matthew Anderson (and therefore his wife, through marriage) would seem to be a cousin of Miss Forrester, because a Matthew Anderson, the son of Matthew Anderson and Anna (Barts) Anderson, was born on 9/20 July 1798 in St. Petersburg. Matthew Anderson Sr. and Anna Barts had married in 1786. As Barts is an uncommon surname, there is strong evidence that Anna (Barts) Anderson and Mary (Barts) Forrester were sisters, because the ages at death given in their burial entries indicate that they were born in around 1762 and 1760–1761 respectively. Thus, if Matthew Anderson, the father of Henry Main Anderson, was indeed the same person as the Matthew Anderson born in 1798, he could well be a first cousin of the misses Forrester (b. 1794, 1796, and 1801), and his wife would be called a cousin to them as well. The idea that there is a connection between the Andersons and the Forresters is further supported by the fact that one of the witnesses at the marriage of Francis Forrester to Mary Barts in 1791 was a Matthew Anderson. Also, three of the witnesses at the marriage of Catherine Margaret Forrester to William Atkinson in 1829 were M. Anderson, Frances Anderson, and John Anderson.</span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-829"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-829-backlink">829</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ekateringof (see <a href="images_14.html#image405" target="_blank">Images 405–406</a>), named for Catherine&#160;I, wife of Peter the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image411" target="_blank">Images 411–412</a>), consists of a park with an ancient wooden palace, avenues for carriages, a music hall, gazebos, a children’s playgound, and eating places. Although the park was named for her, the palace itself was nevertheless usually called the Peter I Palace (see <a href="images_14.html#image405" target="_blank">Image 405</a>). On the seashore there is a pavilion (the farm), which serves as the summer dacha of the military governor general of St. Petersburg. The park is open to the public in spring and summer. On 1/13 May and on Trinity Day, there is always a public celebration here. Ekateringof was established by Peter the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image411" target="_blank">Image 411</a>) together with its wooden palace, which was built in the spring of 1711, to commemorate his first sea victory over the Swedes in May 1703. He presented it to his wife as a summer residence. After his death, it fell into neglect. In 1745, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image413" target="_blank">Image 413</a>) expanded the palace, but most of the new additions were destroyed, and the palace was mostly restored to its original appearance. In 1796, Ekateringof was made part of the city and included in the then newly established Fourth Admiralty District. In 1800, Emperor Paul I (see <a href="images_15.html#image417" target="_blank">Image 417</a>) entrusted Ekateringof to Count von der Pahlen (1745– 1826), at that time governor general of St. Petersburg. In 1804, it was transferred, with all appurtenances, to the jurisdiction of Count A.S. Stroganoff (1733–1811). These measures did not help, and the palace became dilapidated, the woods were fenced in, and – because the site of the garden was marshy – swamps formed, making Ekateringof impassable in bad weather. In 1823, Count M.A. Miloradovich (1771–1825), then military governor general, submitted and received Alexander I’s approval of plans for the restoration of Ekateringof. Work was begun in June 1823, and concluded in November of the same year. The most beautiful structures, the music hall and some of the pavilions, were the work of the architect, Auguste Monferrand (1786–1858), who designed the version of St. Isaac’s Cathedral being built at this time (see <a href="images_6.html#image119" target="_blank">Image 119</a>). In a single summer, a canal was dug, roads and paths laid, the palace rebuilt, the swamps filled in, the ponds cleared, little bridges erected, more than a thousand trees planted, and a children’s playground created. Gutuev Island, which lies opposite, was cleared, and the fishermen’s houses on it were elevated architecturally to resemble rural buildings in the environs of Rome. Ekateringof became once again a palace to which the inhabitants of Kolomna and the Semyonov and Izmailov regiments come, generally by water, to take Sunday excursions. There are many dachas here, distinctive among them that of V.G. Zhukov (1796–1881; see <a href="images_11.html#image323" target="_blank">Image 323</a>). The workers from his tobacco factory camp in the Ekateringof fields at haying time, accompanying their work with the singing for which they are famed. Moreover, villages that become populated with summer people abut on Ekateringof. On Sundays in summer, regimental music plays. Ekateringof is one of those places where smoking is permitted, although it lies within the bounds of the city. Its upkeep is maintained by the city (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburga</span> 1839, pt. 1, pp. 312–317; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Putevoditel’</span>, pp. 312–317, 464; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, pp. 234, 664–666; Grech, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ves’ Peterburg </span>1851, pp. 213–215; Konechnyi, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulki</span>, p. 311; N.I.

The artist, Karl Gampel’n (between 1796–1808 – after 1880), captured the 1/13 May public holiday in an engraving (aquatint) executed in 1825–1826 called <span class="CharOverride-1">Ekateringof Celebration</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Ekateringofskoe gul’ianie</span>) (see <a href="images_14.html#image406" target="_blank">Image 406</a>).

At the entrance to the bridge there are gates from both sides shaped like three arches. Along the sides of the canal is an embankment separating off two clear ponds. In the middle of the ponds, out of respect for antiquity, trees planted in Peter the Great’s time or before his time have been preserved. All along the palace there is a gallery which descends to the canal from both sides. The ponds are shaded by spreading birches. From the other side of the palace, a long avenue for pedestrians stretches through the entire grove. The Peter I Palace is a two-story building of simple architecture, but nonetheless quite spacious. Near it is a gallery from which the curious can see the arrangement and decor of the rooms on the lower floor. The palace has been restored to its former appearance. Its side walls are the same as they were in Peter’s time. The restoration was unusually difficult to effect. From the windows of the palace, ships can be seen sailing by, one after another, like the continuous series of scenes in a panorama. The palace is more spacious now than it was in Peter’s time. The section starting at the hearth room with the two-story hall was added on by Empress Elizaveta Petrovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image413" target="_blank">Image 413</a>). The two stories contain twenty-one rooms. On the lower floor, the decor is much as it originally was: the cupboards, chairs, and all the objects are very plain and correspond to the simple life led by Peter the Great (see <a href="images_15.html#image411" target="_blank">Image 411</a>). Upstairs, where no decorations remained, the rooms are decorated quite luxuriously. The palace contains many precious mementos of Peter the Great, some made by him, others gifted by him and donated by the descendants of recipients to decorate the restored palace. In every room there is an icon; the icon of the Vladimir Mother of God in front of Peter’s bedroom is the same one that was here when he was alive. The palace also contains a library of Russian books relating to the history of Peter the Great. On the upper floor there are rooms filled with Chinese objects. Other rooms on this floor are decorated magnificently with furniture and hangings that once embellished the chambers of empresses Catherine&#160;I (see <a href="images_15.html#image412" target="_blank">Image 412</a>) and Elizaveta Petrovna (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, pp. 153–167; Batorevich, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ekateringof</span>, pp. 126–131).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Bozherianov, explaining that a part of Peter the Great’s possessions and curiosities of his era were transferred from the Ekateringof Palace to the Petrine Gallery of the Imperial Hermitage in the early 1850s, says that a description of all the things in the Ekateringof Palace may be found in Pushkarev’s guide (I.N. Bozherianov, “Ekateringof,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Russkaia starina</span> 41 (March 1884): p. 629). As one of Pushkarev’s guides was published in 1843, it would therefore seem possible to identify everything to which Anna Whistler refers. Actually, however, Pushkarev’s description is limited to those things he thinks may be of particular interest to the visitor (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Putevoditel’</span>, pp. 313–317). Far more detail about the contents of the Ekateringof Palace rooms can be found in Bur’ianov’s guide for children, which, while charming and patriotic, is also very knowledgeable (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, pp.153–167). His descriptions are too extensive to be reproduced in their entirety here. They, too, do not cover all the objects Anna Whistler selects for mention.</p>

In a splendidly decorated corner room on the upper floor of the palace there is a wooden snuffbox under a glass cloche, with the inscription “From His Majesty, made by his own hand, presented to Lieutenant Joseph Botom [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] of the Navy” engraved on a little brass strip. Peter made the snuffbox with a non-removable lid, the upper half of which slides open (Bur’ianov,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, p. 157; Pushkarev,<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>1839, pt. 1, pp. 314–315; Pushkarev,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Putevoditel’</span>, pp. 314–31; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, p. 236; Batorevich, <span class="CharOverride-1">Ekateringof</span>, p. 128). In Peter’s bedroom on the first floor there is a plain old pine bed devoid of decoration that is avowed by oldtimers to be his own handiwork (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, p. 155; Pushkarev,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Opisanie Sanktpeterburga </span>1839, pt. 1, pp. 313–314; Pushkarev,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Putevoditel’</span>, pp. 313–314; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Nikolaevskii Peterburg</span>, p. 235). “Alexander Bottom (1763–1828) was nominated Kommander of the Peterhof factory [Peterhof Lapidary Factory] in 1801, following in the footsteps of his father Joseph (Iossip) Bottom (1711–1788), himself the son of an English sailor serving in the Russian fleet and director for thirty years until his death” (Antoine Chenevière, <span class="CharOverride-1">Russian Furniture: The Golden Age, 1780–1840</span> [London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988], p. 269).</span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-833"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-833-backlink">833</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several rooms with Chinese objects on the upper floor of the palace. At the top of the stairs, one sees a model of a Chinese galley, Chinese lanterns, and two human-sized stuffed dolls, representing subjects of the emperor, made of silk and attached to lacquered boards. On the walls were views of amusement parks with kiosks and sailing boats. In a nearby room were Chinese lacquered screens with gilt on black, with a picturesque depiction of the ceremonial departure of the Chinese emperor in his chariot, accompanied by his suite. In the same room were Chinese cupboards, chests of drawers, and bureaus with many drawers, some of them secret; these objects were as remarkable in their inner structure as in their outer appearance. Of two large pictures, one made on satin depicts flowers and birds with extraordinary liveliness, while the other, made on wood, with ivory figures pasted on and colored, represents a view of Chinese buildings in the countryside, the hunt, and a public celebration. The decor of these rooms reaches its high point in several chairs of unusual shape, the lacquered chamois pillows of which are supported on gilded monster heads. A curtain in Chinese taste covers the door. There are also straw blinds, two fans and, finally, ten elongated satin pictures embroidered with silk and depicting multi-colored parrots and luxuriant roses, songbirds on bushes in fields, etc. One cannot help but be astonished at the freshness of the flowers, the brightness of the colors, the brilliant play of colors in the silk, and the liveliness in imitating nature. To the side is another small Chinese study. Here, there are remarkable tables with landscapes on black with gilt and marble screens with charming depictions of a Chinese wedding. The arrival of the bridegroom, the emergence of the bride-to-be from her father’s house, etc. are represented on the ten panels of the screen in small pictures, below which at the bottom are fruits and flowers. In addition to the extraordinary artistry of their finish, the screens give a curious picture of Chinese customs. All these objects were probably brought from Peking during the lifetime of Peter the Great by Captain of the Life Guards Lev Izmailov, whom he sent as minister plenipotentiary to the emperor of China. Izmailov left St. Petersburg with ten thousand rubles for the purchase of various articles in Peking. One can also presume that some of the pieces of furniture were gifts in exchange for those sent to the Chinese emperor by Peter the Great. There is no specific mention, however, of a Chinese cabinet with ivory inlay (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, pp. 160-163. Pushkarev mentions only a few objects and gives no detail (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburga </span>1839, pt. 1, p. 312; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Putevoditel’</span>, p. 315; Batorevich mentions a large number of objects [<span class="CharOverride-1">Ekateringof</span>, pp. 132–137]).</span></p>

In one, they say, the walls were covered with white velvet with bouquets of flowers depicted on it. In other rooms, Bur’ianov says, the furniture was covered with tiger velvet, satin and damask (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, p. 164), but Pushkarev says these materials covered the walls (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Putevoditel’</span>, p. 316). Anna Whistler probably meant tapestries, however. In yet another room, Bur’ianov says, the walls were decorated with tapestries by Russian artists, except for one of flowers and fruits by a foreign artist so realistic that birds could be deceived by it (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, p. 164). Pushkarev mentions <span class="CharOverride-1">Bathsheba Bathing</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Kupaiushchaiasia Virsaviia</span>), also called <span class="CharOverride-1">Bathsheba at the Fountain</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Virsaviia u fontana</span>), woven in 1727, and <span class="CharOverride-1">Dogs in a Slaughterhouse</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Sobaki v boine</span>), woven in 1755, as noteworthy (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Putevoditel’</span>, p. 316).

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-847"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-847-backlink">847</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1792, at the end of Catherine the Great’s reign, Giacomo Quarenghi (1744–1817) began the construction for her favorite grandson of a great palace, called the New (Alexander) Palace (see <a href="images_14.html#image388" target="_blank">Images 388</a>, <a href="images_16.html#image447" target="_blank">447</a>). It was located in the northeast end of the New Garden and “to the east of the main entrance to the Catherine Palace,” its “main façade overlooking a pond” (Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, p. 102; Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 210; Hamilton, <span class="CharOverride-1">Art and Architechture</span>, p. 201; Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 299). It was essentially completed in May of 1796, the year of Catherine’s death. On 12 June (OS) 1796, Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich (the future Alexander I; see <a href="images_15.html#image418" target="_blank">Image 418</a>) moved in (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 210). When he became emperor five years later, he moved to the Catherine Palace (see <a href="images_14.html#image385" target="_blank">Image 385</a>), which he preferred. Nicholas&#160;I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>), however, preferred the New (Alexander) Palace. He would move to Tsarskoe Selo in early spring and stay until the end of May, when the troops went to camp near Peterhof for maneuvers. When maneuvers were over, the Court would return to Tsarskoe Selo and then move back to St. Petersburg about 24 November (Vil’chkovskii, p. 211). In 1800, the palace was stuccoed and “the architectural detail was delineated in white against a yellow background” (Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 301). In contrast to the Catherine Palace, the exterior of the New (Alexander) Palace is marked by a simplicity and severity of style (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 211). There are “no window surrounds and only a drip line separating the first and second floors” (Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 301). The building consists of a main façade with two perpendicular wings. Two perpendicular pavilions extend from along the main façade. A “double Cornithian colonnade” of snow-white stone unites the two pavilions and “create[s] an enclosed entrance court” (Brumfield, pp. 299, 301). The building has a dentilated cornice “surmounted by a balustrade” (Brumfield, p. 301). The colonnade also carries the entire entablature of the Corinthian order and the balustrade, which are continued above the entire building. The proportions of the colonnade are faultless. It is particularly fine when looked at from up close, from the inner courtyard. The free-standing columns are perceived then against the background of the sky and the landscape of the park. The entrances into the building are situated along the sides of the colonnade in the gable ends of the pavilions. This compositional feature marked a departure from the accent on the central axis of the building traditional to the architecture of Classicism. The palace did not have a main entrance marked by a portico and pediment, and therefore also did not have a sharply defined main façade (Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, p. 102). On the park façade at the rear there is a “projecting central pavilion with [a] dome” (Hamilton, <span class="CharOverride-1">Art and Architechture</span>, p. 201). This feature, too, did not accent the central axis of the building. The palace does not dominate the park ensemble, but is part of it and unites harmoniously with the landscape, in this respect differing essentially from the Catherine Palace (Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, p. 102). While the interior of the palace underwent significant changes in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the external appearance did not for more than one hundred fifty years (Petrov, pp. 102, 103). In 1817, lilac bushes were planted in front of the palace and colonnade. They spread, eventually partially hiding the palace from view (Petrov, p. 103), as can be seen in <a href="images_14.html#image388" target="_blank">Image 388</a>. In front of the colonnade, between the wings, there was until 1847 an open macadamized area (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 211). In 1838, two cast-iron statues, each of a youth playing an ancient Russian game, were placed in front of the colonnade. The models for them were sculptures executed by pupils of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts and shown at the annual Academy exhibition in 1836: a youth playing “knucklebones” (<span class="CharOverride-1">babki</span>) by N.S. Pimenov (1812– 1864) and another playing “nail into the ring” (<span class="CharOverride-1">svaika</span>) by A.V. Loganovskii (1810–1855) (for illustrations of these games, see <a href="images_13.html#image356" target="_blank">Images 356–357</a>) (Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, p. 102; Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 211). Although not intended for installation in front of the palace, they are said to combine successfully with the Classical colonnade (Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, p. 103). In 1843, the first electromagnetic telegraph in Russia was set up in the study of Nicholas&#160;I in the New (Alexander) Palace, connecting with the study of the director of the Main Administration of Transport and Public Buildings, Count Pyotr Andreevich Kleinmikhel’ (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 211). Except for their 1846 visit to the newly built oratory in this palace, Anna Whistler does not record visiting any other part of it.</span></p>

Chevakinskii (1713– 1770s); it was redesigned by Rastrelli for Empress Elizaveta Petrovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image413" target="_blank">Image 413</a>) and built between 1747 and 1754. Mon Bijou consisted of a central octagonal two-tiered brick structure with a cupola and with four single-storied adjoining rooms extended from it on intersecting diagonals (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 195; Brumfield, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Russian Architecture</span>, p. 241). It was considered a gem of Russian Baroque architecture. Adam Menelaws (1753–1831), remodeling it as a dwelling for Alexander I (see <a href="images_15.html#image418" target="_blank">Image 418</a>), modeled it on a pavilion at Shrubs Hill, a Gothic castle in England. The work was begun by him in 1819. After his death, supervision of the construction was given to Alexander A. Ton (1794–1881). The work was concluded in 1834. In the remodeling, four hexagonal, three-tiered towers were fused into one whole with the central two-storied mass that remained from Mon Bijou, each tower being joined to it by one of its six sides. The tower walls are finished off with cornices and crenelated parapets. Each of the towers is crowned with a Gothic turret. Wide window openings were cut through the walls of the central mass. The whitewashed plaster platbands and arches above the windows stand out against the brick walls, which were left unplastered as in medieval English castles (Petrov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Pushkin: Dvortsy i parki</span>, p. 111; <span class="CharOverride-1">Pamiatniki arkhitektury prigorodov Leningrada</span>, p. 120). The windows had transoms with insets of Gothic designs. Many of the windows contained panes of old German and Swiss glass depicting Biblical stories, German and Swiss sixteenth- and seventeenth-century subjects, and armor and weapons of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (F. Gille, ed., <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei s sobraniem oruzhiia, prinadlezhashchego Gosudariu Imperatoru</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">The Tsarskoe Selo Museum and the Collection of Arms Belonging to His Majesty the Emperor</span>] [St. Petersburg: A.

The remodeled building became a museum housing a rich collection of ancient arms and armor (see <a href="images_14.html#image392" target="_blank">Image 392</a>) that Nicholas&#160;I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>) had started in 1811, when a young Grand Duke. The collection, housed since 1817 in the Anichkov Palace in St. Petersburg (see <a href="images_6.html#image133" target="_blank">Images 133–134</a>), had been transferred to the Alexander Palace when he became emperor. The subsequent expansion of the collection led to the decision to house it in the pseudo-Gothic building, which, on the basis of an order issued by Nicholas&#160;I in 1834, was to be called the Armory (L. Tarasiuk, <span class="CharOverride-1">Starinnoe ognestrel’noe oruzhie v sobranii Èrmitazha. Evropa i severnaia Amerika</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Old Russian Firearms in the Collection of the Hermitage: Europe and North America</span>] [Leningrad: Iskusstvo, Leningradskoe otdelenie, 1971], pp. 8, 9).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">The names of some of the rooms differed over the years. In 1842, Pushkarev’s guide noted on the first floor the Generals’ Room, picture room, library, Indian Room, and Her Majesty’s cloakroom and bedroom, and on the second floor the dining room, Russian or Slavonic Room, Polish Room, and Turkish Room (Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburga</span> 1842, pp. 74–76). A plan of the Armory published in the 1860 catalogue describes the lower floor as consisting of a vestibule, large hall, study, empress’s room, library and Russian Room, firearms room, Albanian Room and main [stone] staircase. On the upper floor were located the Hall of Knights, the Indo-Muslim Room, the Turkish Room, the Indo-Persian Room and [iron] staircase (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, plan facing title page). Prior to this, the Indo-Muslim Room had been the Russian Room (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei,</span> pp. 147a, 266). The Albanian Room did not carry this name when the Whistlers visited the Armory. It was set up after the death, in 1849, of Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, who willed his collection of arms to his nephew, the Heir to the Throne, Grand Duke Aleksandr Nikolaevich (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei,</span> pp. 86–87). The empress’s room was another name for the bedroom (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei,</span> pp. vi, ix). The dining room was the Hall of Knights (identified by descriptions of the coats-of-arms of the Russian provinces on its walls) (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei,</span> p. 131; Pushkarev, <span class="CharOverride-1">Opisanie Sanktpeterburga</span> 1842, p. 75). The blinds in the Armory were red (Benois, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. xxxiii). Instead of the proposed marble floors, Nicholas&#160;I chose wooden parquet floors (Benois, p. xxxii). Objects were displayed in cases and cupboards in the rooms and towers as well as on the winding staircases and on the slender iron columns supporting the staircases. Groups of objects were picturesquely hung on the walls as units (<span class="CharOverride-1">trofei</span>). The items exhibited were labelled (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, pp. 91–130). In 1836, rules for visitors were approved. The public was allowed entrance on Wednesdays and Sundays from ten to six, in winter until two. Distinguished guests with tickets could visit every day. A guest book was kept for recording the names of acceptable visitors and keeping out undesirables. (I checked the Hermitage Archives in July 2003 and was told that these guest books are not in their collection.) When the Court was in residence at Tsarskoe Selo, admittance to the Armory was by special order. Special officers were attached to the Armory (Benois, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. xxxiii). They were non-commissioned Guards veterans (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 197). There were guides (entry for Wed [August] 28 [1844], NYPL: AWPD, Part I) and guidebooks (Bur’ianov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Progulka s det’mi</span>, vol. 3, p. 119).

			<p class="Endnote-text4">In 1840, Charles Seyger (Russian initials: K.I.), librarian to Nicholas&#160;I, died. His replacement was Florian Gille (1801– 1864), who filled the two posts of head of the palace libraries and of the Division of Antiquities at the Hermitage. He was director of the Armory for some twenty-five years. During his tenure, the collection grew from three thousand to five thousand objects (Tarasiuk, <span class="CharOverride-1">Starinnoe ognestrel’noe oruzhie</span>, p. 9). In 1886, now numbering over seven thousand objects, it was transferred to the Hermitage (Tarasiuk, p. 11). It is possible, however, to have a good idea of some of the objects Anna Whistler’s party saw at the Armory through publications that appeared long before the transfer. In 1840, the first catalogue of the collection in the Russian language, prepared by K.I. Seyger, was published: <span class="CharOverride-1">Katalog redkogo, starinnogo i vostochnogo oruzhiia, khraniashchegosia v sobstvennom Ego Imperatorskogo Velichestva Arsenale v Tsarskom-Sele</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Catalogue of Rare, Ancient and Eastern Arms in His Imperial Majesty’s Own Armory in Tsarskoe Selo</span>], 2 vols. (St. Petersburg: Eduard Prats, 1840). It was actually an inventory of 2747 items, grouped according to twenty categories, such as “armor,” “shields,” etc. (F. Gille, comp., <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei s sobraniem oruzhiia, prinadlezhashchego Gosudariu Imperatoru</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">The Tsarskoe Selo Museum and the Collection of Arms Belonging to His Majesty the Emperor</span>] [St. Petersburg: A.

In 1835, a serial edition of lithographs of outstanding objects in the Armory was begun. These lithographs were based on watercolor drawings executed by A.P. Rockstuhl (1798– 1877) and others. It was completed and published in 1853 in French with the title <span class="CharOverride-1">Musée du Tsarskoé-Sélo ou collection d’armes de Sa Majesté L’Empereur de toutes les Russies.

These publications have been helpful in ascertaining and describing some of the objects that were of particular interest to the Whistlers.</p>

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-849"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-849-backlink">849</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Armory had in its collection suits of German, Italian, French, Swiss, Austrian, Spanish, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Indo-Muslim, and Persian armor. The specific reference in the diaries is to two elegant suits of Maximilian armor of German workmanship from the beginning of the sixteenth century that were worn by Nicholas&#160;I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420&#8211;423</a>) and Grand Duke Aleksandr Nikolaevich (see <a href="images_15.html#image420" target="_blank">Image 420</a>) during the medieval “carousel” which took place in Tsarskoe Selo on 23 May /4 June 1842 to celebrate the silver wedding anniversary of Nicholas&#160;I and Empress Aleksandra Fyodorovna. The “carousel” set out from the Armory and proceeded to the esplanade of the Alexander Palace, where a tournament was held. Sixteen cavaliers and sixteen ladies participated. The ladies were in medieval dress, the cavaliers in sixteenth-century armor from the Armory. The armor worn by Nicholas&#160;I and Grand Duke Aleksandr Nikolaevich was taken from the empress’s room (bedroom) of the Armory. The young grand dukes were dressed as pages (Vil’chkovskii, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, pp. 196–197; Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, pp. ix, 66–67, 107, 109, 133, 134–136; Benois, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskoe Selo</span>, p. 218). For further details and differing numbers see Wortman, <span class="CharOverride-1">Scenarios of Power</span>, vol. 1, p. 340. Plate 1 of Kaemmerer, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii arsenal</span>, illustrates the suit of armor worn by Nicholas&#160;I, Plate 5 that worn by his son. Both plates are accompanied by texts in Russian and French. A portrait of the Imperial family during the 1842 carousel was committed to canvas by Horace Vernet (1789–1863) in 1843 (see <a href="images_15.html#image420" target="_blank">Image 420</a>). Aleksandra Fyodorovna dominates the painting, seated on a white horse in the center. To her right is Nicholas&#160;I, and beyond him and further in the background Grand Duke Aleksandr Nikolaevich and the Duke of Leuchtenberg, her son-in-law. Behind her to her left are the grand duchesses Olga Nikolaevna and Aleksandra Nikolaevna and Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich. To her left in the foreground stand the little grand dukes, Nikolai Nikolaevich and Mikhail Nikolaevich (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, pp. ix–x; Wortman, <span class="CharOverride-1">Scenarios of Power</span>, vol. 1, p. 340).

The 1840 catalogue describes the saddle simply as covered with silver plates (<span class="CharOverride-1">bliashki</span>) (Seyger, <span class="CharOverride-1">Katalog redkogo oruzhiia</span>, vol. 2, p. 157). It is described in the 1860 catalogue as made of silver with convex chasing (<span class="CharOverride-1">vypuklaia chekanka</span>) (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, p. 137). The plate illustrating the saddle does not help clarify either statement (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei,</span> vol. 4, p. 263, plate 30). The pommel had the elegant form of what was thought to be a curving swan’s neck (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, p. 137). In both catalogues, it is recorded that the saddle had belonged to Tipoo Sahib (1751–1799), the last Nabob of Mysore (Seyger, <span class="CharOverride-1">Katalog redkogo oruzhiia</span>, vol. 2, p. 157; Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, pp. viii, 137). Neither catalogue records his armor or horse. The 1840 catalogue explains that the other saddle parts grouped with Tipoo Sahib’s saddle do not belong to it (Seyger, <span class="CharOverride-1">Katalog redkogo oruzhiia</span>, vol. 2, pp. 157–158). The 1860 catalogue describes some armor placed near Tipoo Sahib’s saddle, but says it is not his (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, pp. 136–137). His sword was located elsewhere in the Armory and is described in the 1860 catalogue (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, pp. 220–221). Later scholarship has established that the saddle was acquired for the Arsenal in 1836 in Paris from the collector F. Civilotti, as belonging to Tipoo Sahib (Iu. Miller, “Sedlo i sablia Tippu-Saiba” [“A Saddle and Sword Belonging to Tipoo Sahib”], <span class="CharOverride-1">Soobshcheniia Gosudarstvennogo Ermitazha</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Reports of the State Hermitage Museum</span>] 10 [1956]: pp. 45–46). It has been suggested that the bird’s head is that of the mythological bird Garuda, which appears frequently in Indian art (Miller, “Sedlo i sablia Tippu-Saiba,” p. 46). The seat of the saddle is covered in red satin with a white design (Miller, “Sedlo i sablia Tippu-Saiba,” p. 46).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-853"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-853-backlink">853</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Miller made an inquiry of the Department of Antiquities at the Hermitage. It has in its collection ancient Greek and Roman weaponry and some helmets from the Crimea, where archaeological excavations were carried on from the beginning of the nineteenth century, but no helmet from Herculaneum (Iu. Miller, St. Petersburg, to E. Harden, 19 October 2001). If we assume that Anna Whistler could have made a mistake in her attribution, we can propose that the object she saw was an ancient Greek bronze helmet, totally covered with rust, with two ear protectors, and decorations on it of consummate taste, found in a tomb in the environs of Kerch, a seaport in the Western Crimea, near ancient Panticapaeum (Seyger, <span class="CharOverride-1">Katalog redkogo oruzhiia</span>, vol. 2, p. 140, item 405).</span></p>

This enormous lock was on the door of the Great Hall (Hall of Knights). It was found in 1839 in Jerusalem, in a ditch that encircled the wooden tower of David, and was obtained by the Russian consul in Jaffa, who sent it to the then minister of Finances, Count Kankrin, for presentation to Nicholas&#160;I. The lock is made of forged iron, weighs 38½ pounds, is square in shape, and is more than nine inches across. The mechanism consists of a cylinder four inches in diameter. The key, which is thirteen inches long and weighs five pounds, fits into an opening made in the iron casing of the cylinder and at a certain distance from the orifice of the cylinder presses on six springs of the most clever construction, as a result of which the lock opens. To lock it again, one has only to remove the key and the springs return to normal position and go back into their chambers, once again uniting the opened parts. In the lower part of the lock may be seen an indentation which probably held a silver plate with a depiction of the cross of Jerusalem on it, but unfortunately the plate has been lost. The two sections comprising the head of the key also form a cross of Jerusalem. The coat-of-arms of the Jerusalem Latin Kingdom consists of a shield, on the silver of which is depicted a double gold cross, which is counter to the rule of heraldry that requires that color should not be placed on color nor metal on metal. This deviation from the accepted rule was made so that later generations should seek a valid reason as to why this incorrect coat-of-arms (<span class="CharOverride-1">armes à enquérir</span>) was formed. The external appearance of the lock, together with its size and weight, prove that it was used for locking city or tower gates, while the representation of the cross of Jerusalem repeated on the lock and key may serve to indicate when it was made – probably at the end of the twelfth century, when the Crusaders still held Jerusalem. The lock has survived intact and in good working order, thanks to its thick iron walls, while the mechanism is located so deep that it could not be subject to rust. It was also preserved by the dry Jerusalem soil and the hot climate (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, pp. 129–130; Williams, <span class="CharOverride-1">Holy City</span>, [pp. 504–505]); <span class="CharOverride-1">Illiustratsiia.

The first set mentioned by Anna Whistler was presented to Nicholas&#160;I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>) as a token of gratitude for aid rendered in 1833, when he sent a detachment of Russian troops to Unkiar-Skelessi to stop Ibrahim Pasha, son of Mehemet Ali, who, after defeating the Turks at Nezib, was menacing Constantinople. This gift consisted of a saddlecloth, harness, pistols, holsters, and stirrups. The saddle cloth was made of dark blue cloth with a red cloth border and gold fringe. Along the border and in the corners were embroidered in thread of gold arrows, quivers, and torches intertwined with laurel leaves and decorated with large diamonds. All the remaining pieces, except for the stirrups, were also studded with diamonds. The other set, consisting of a saddlecloth, harness, pistol holsters, and a saber, was sent to Nicholas&#160;I by Sultan Mahmud II after the conclusion of the Peace of Adrianople in 1829. The saddlecloth was made of pale lilac-colored cloth with diamonds along the border. The diamonds were placed in designs sewn with thread of gold depicting garlands of flowers and leaves tied with ribbons and bows. In the corners of the saddlecloth were military trophies also sewn with thread of gold and decorated with diamonds. The fringe on the saddlecloth was also thread of gold and decorated with brightly colored silk tassels. The saber had a Damascus steel blade 35 English inches long. The other parts of the saber and the scabbard were of gold, covered with pale lilac enamel with diamond garlands like those on the saddlecloth. The remaining pieces were made of glossy black leather and decorated with gold armatures and with many diamonds set in small panels of chased gold. The 1829 set is represented in Plate 29 of Kaemmerer, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii arsenal</span>, the 1833 set in Plate 30. The detail given above is taken from the text in Kaemmerer, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii arsenal</span> (facing the plates). Both sets are also described and historical detail given in the 1840 catalogue (Seyger, <span class="CharOverride-1">Katalog redkogo oruzhiia</span>, vol. 2, pp. 3– 4) and the 1860 catalogue (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, pp. 201– 202).

In the 1860 catalogue, the portrait and masks are described in greater detail (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, pp. 80–81). Reference is made in the 1860 catalogue to Swedish cuirasses transferred to the Tsarskoe Selo Armory from the Narva Armory (Gille, <span class="CharOverride-1">Tsarskosel’skii muzei</span>, p. 122), but no mention is made in these works of bejeweled swords taken from the Swedes in battles between Peter the Great and Charles XII. In response to this passage, Nils Drejholt of the Royal Armory in Stockholm pointed out that “there might be swords or sabres set with precious stones belonging to Swedish officers, but then they must have been taken as booty during the war or gifts from officer colleagues, they were never used in the field” (Nils Drejholt, Stockholm, to E. Harden, 18 January 2002). Dr. Yuri Miller said it would be rather difficult from such a description to establish which swords in the collection were the right ones, as the collection contains numerous swords of this type decorated with precious stones.

			<p class="Endnote-text3"><span id="endnote-866"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-866-backlink">866</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither Miss McLean’s first name nor important dates of her life appear in any of the documents I have consulted. Some additional information about Miss McLean and her life as a governess can be inferred from material in the Olenin Archive in the Rukopisnyi otdel Rossiiskoi natsional’noi biblioteki (RNB OR) [Manuscript Division of the Russian National Library], St. Petersburg. One item is a list, dated 7 February 1842, of subjects to be studied, set by the father of Miss McLean’s charge when his daughter, nicknamed Aty (or Attie), was seven. They are: religion, Russian, French, German, English, geography, history, arithmetic, penmanship, drawing, music, and dancing. This is followed by a timetable showing that she had lessons every day of the week, including Sunday, when for one hour in the morning she studied religion. The second item is a letter written by Aty to her father, when she was seven. Dated 9 June 1842 and written in good English, it mentions Miss McLean twice: “if I am good and learn well, dear Papa will you buy me a Microscope, I have been learning about Snow, and Miss McLean tells me that it is very curious to look at it through a Microscope … Miss McLean begs to be remembered to Grand Mama and yourself.”</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">On a third item, which consists of verses in English, it says “Atty, aged <span class="CharOverride-1">10</span> years!” In the hand of her mother, but apparently written at a much later date, it says: “To me” and “In childhood how well she wrote but later …” The material copied here by the child is called “The Tzar and the two Shepherds.” It begins: “The Tzar has wandered from the city-gate.” The Tzar then meets two shepherds in succession. The first cannot by himself manage his “poor lean flocks,” decimated by the wolf because the shepherd’s lazy dogs sleep in the shade. The Tzar is comforted to see that there “is another sovereign, just like me.” But as he continues to wander, he meets “the loveliest flock that ever grazed” and finds their shepherd under a linden tree, playing a pipe. Though a lamb strays and the wolf appears, that shepherd’s vigilant dogs drive the wolf away. All the while, the shepherd goes on playing. The Tzar loses all patience with him and berates him for his lack of concern despite his success, but receives the answer: “Tzar! here no evil can betide my sheep / My dogs are faithful and they do not sleep.”</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">From these items we can infer that in August 1844 Miss McLean had been governess to Aty for at least two-and-a-half years; that somewhere in that long day of study, in addition to the subjects in the timetable set by the little girl’s father, she introduced her, and early, to the then unfeminine subject of science, and captured her interest; and that like many a British governess she attempted to give her foreign charge a political education along the way (RNB OR: Fond 542, no. 1011, Stoianovskaia (rozhd.

Two letters to her father written at the age of seven, a timetable of lessons, a toy depiction of a carriage and exercises in the English language.]) The “toy depiction” consists of pictures of three types of carriages: one black and white, and two colored. On the back of each, it says “Made by Crichton and Feild Edinburgh,” who were “coachmakers of Leith Walk” (Jeremy Howard, <span class="CharOverride-1">William Allan: Artist Adventurer</span>, with contributions from John Morrison, Sara Stevenson and Andrzej Szczerski [Edinburgh: City of Edinburgh Museums and Galleries, 2001], p. 43).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Miss McLean was still with the family in the early 1850s, when the widowed Varvara Alekseevna was living on her Voronezh estate as well as in the city of Voronezh, and Aty was at least sixteen (N.N.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">General Ia.V. Zakharzhevskii was in charge of the town of Tsarskoe Selo and its Imperial palaces and conservatories, He was considered a person of rare honesty.

			<p class="Endnote-text4">The requisite that cleanliness and order had to be maintained in the gardens and on the streets approached pedantism; thus, they were kept in model fashion: if you were in a vehicle, it was as though you were gliding on a parquet floor and no piece of parquetry anywhere shifted; if you were on foot, even after a torrential rainstorm you could cross the street in satin slippers without soiling them. Zakharzhevskii had lost a leg but he could walk fast with his crutch.</p>	
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Legend has it that in order to catch officers who trampled the lawn when on horseback, he disguised himself as a Chinaman and took the place of one of them on a bridge. A Hussar officer, a young rake, riding past Zakharzhevskii on the bridge recognized him, got down off his horse, pulled up some grass, and, going over to the disguised Chinaman, began to pass it under his nose to make him sneeze, but the Chinaman maintained his role, not even blinking. </p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Legend also has it that he was spoken of, especially by the peasants of Tsarskoe Selo District, as being of blessed memory (M.A. Patkul’, <span class="CharOverride-1">Vospominaniia Marii Aleksandrovny Patkul’</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">The Memoirs of Maria Aleksandrovna Patkul’</span>] [St. Petersburg: A.S.

After the Tsarskoe Selo–Pavlovsk stretch was opened on 22 May (OS) 1838, he started the first musical evenings, which began as musical entertainment “by local ensembles and military bands” during dinner, and also dancing. Actual concerts were established somewhat later. In the early years, the railway administration thought the Pavlovsk Pleasure Garden could function year round. The director of the winter concerts, whose brief term lasted for part of 1839, was the Austrian violinist, choirmaster, and well-known composer of ballroom dances, Iosif Labitskii (1802–1881) “from Karlsbad in Bohemia.” A troupe of Moscow gypsies also had a successful run during the winter months, along with Labitskii. But despite their success, in January 1840 the administration of the railway took a decision to eliminate the winter performances. Overlapping with Labitskii’s tenure and appointed as the first permanent director of summer concerts at the Pavlovsk Pleasure Garden was Jozef Hermann (see <a href="images_8.html#image201" target="_blank">Image 201</a>), from Vienna, who performed there for six summer seasons (1839–1844). Hermann’s successor from 1845–1848 was Johann Gungl (1828–1883). He was replaced by his uncle, Joseph Gungl (1810–1889), who gave concerts with his Berlin Symphony Orchestra in 1850–1855. From 1856 through 1865, and in 1869, the director was the famed Johann Strauss (1825–1899). While the first forty plus years were devoted to ballroom music, classical music was also performed, and a military orchestra at times vied with the concerts (N.B., “Pavlovskii vokzal” [“The Pavlovsk Pleasure Garden”], <span class="CharOverride-1">Stolitsa i usad’ba </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">The Capital and the Country Estate</span>] 40–41 [September 1, 1915]; Haywood, <span class="CharOverride-1">Beginnings</span>, pp. 127–128, 136, 138–139, 140, 141-142; Petrovskaia, <span class="CharOverride-1">Kontsertnaia zhizn Peterburga</span>, pp. 118, 124, 140, 178; Rozanov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Polina Viardo-Garsia</span>, pp. 24– 62). </span></p>

The house was registered in the name of Mariia Ivanova Ritter, wife of a Narva merchant, Robert Vil’gel’mov Ritter. Announcement of its purchase was recorded on 24 June (OS) 1837 in a register listing city residents (Tsentral’nyi gosudarstvennyi istoricheskii arkhiv Sankt Peterburga (TsGIA SPb) [Central State Historical Archive of St. Petersburg]: Fond 781, op. 4, d. 78 Alfavit gorodskoi obyvatel’skoi knigi “R” [Alphabetical book, letter “R”, of city residents], 1820, fol. 34. Although dated 1820, the volume goes up to 1873. The address of the house was No. 237/293 English Embankment, First Admiralty District, First Ward. Anna Whistler clearly recorded in her first diary entry after moving in that it was called Ritter’s house and noted this fact more than once. The family lived on the third floor.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text4">Two books by T.A. Solovieva on the history of the buildings on the English Embankment – the second (2004) a fuller version of the first (1998) – while they give much valuable information, require further research on the house in which the Whistlers lived. These books create several problems, the most important of which is the ownership of the house. Apparently, this particular building was unusual in that at times “[in] its history it was divided into two separate houses,” “then united into one again” (T.A. Solovieva, <span class="CharOverride-1">K prichalam Angliiskoi naberezhnoi. Putevoditel’ </span>[<span class="CharOverride-1">To the Piers of the English Embankment:</span> <span class="CharOverride-1">A Reference Guide</span>], Po ‘glavnoi ulitse’ Sankt-Peterburga [Along “The Main Street” of St. Petersburg] [St. Petersburg: Icarus, 1998], p. 164; this is a bilingual Russian–English edition, but the translation given here is mine). The Whistlers are said to have lived in the house on the right, but the owners from whom they rented are given as the Shakhovskoi family, members of the nobility, to whom the house belonged as of 1796 (Solovieva, <span class="CharOverride-1">K prichalam</span>, p. 153). The name of Ritter is not mentioned at all in conjunction with either the right or the left house. In a phone conversation, Solovieva, in answer to my objections, said she would research further, but I have not since heard from her; therefore, the only information about the building that can be accepted by me for the time being is the record in the “Book of City Residents” and what Anna Whistler herself writes about their home.

George had been in Honolulu three days when he learned of a vessel sailing for Kamchatka and took the opportunity to write and bring his family up to date on his life from the time he had left Anna Whistler at Travemünde. The <span class="CharOverride-1">Lausanne</span>, in which he had sailed to the Sandwich Islands, was not going to the mouth of the Columbia River, as originally scheduled, but returning immediately to the United States. As George did not wish to arrive in the United States in winter, he planned to leave the <span class="CharOverride-1">Lausanne</span> and visit the various islands, returning home on another ship the next summer (1845). He was in good spirits. His health had improved constantly from the time of his departure from New York, so much so that he considered himself quite well. He had had some hard times, however: they had “lost all their fresh provisions and vegetables soon after sailing and lived upon nothing but salt pork and beef and rice for 140 days” (Major G.W. Whistler to General Joseph Gardner Swift, St. Petersburg, entry of November 5 in letter of October 28, 1844, NYPL: Swift Papers).
