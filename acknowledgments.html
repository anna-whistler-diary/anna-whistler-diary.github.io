			<p class="Heading-1" lang="en-US">Acknowledgments</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-US">In preparing this annotated edition of Anna Whistler’s St.&#160;Petersburg diaries of 1843–1848, I have come to a profound awareness of how beholden I am to the many people and organizations who have helped me. I have accumulated grateful and delighted cause to thank them, which I do now with deep gratitude, great pleasure, and, I&#160;hope, sufficient self-effacement.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-US">My research travel would not have been possible without the generosity of funding institutions. I thank the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada and the International Research and Exchanges Board for their fellowships to do research in St.&#160;Petersburg and Moscow; the National Endowment for the Humanities for a summer fellowship to do research in Washington, DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia; the Office of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and the Office of the President of Simon Fraser University for numerous research travel grants; and the Dean of Arts Fund for Retired Faculty of Simon Fraser University.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-US">Of the individuals who helped me, my greatest debt is to my London researcher, Michael J. Welch, a fellow nitpicker, whom I thank with all my heart for his astounding familiarity with the archives of the United Kingdom, his thoroughness, unflappableness, modesty, love of research, sound interpretation, and enormous interest in my topic. He has given me years of his life to accomplish my goal, and I can never thank him enough.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-US">Next I want to express my sincerest gratitude to Margaret Ziviski, who beautifully transcribed the very difficult and frustrating manuscript (see <a href="images_1.html#image6" target="_blank">Image 6</a>) of Anna Whistler’s St.&#160;Petersburg diaries as a summer project, while an undergraduate at Simon Fraser University, thus enabling me and all those who did research for me to move ahead.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-US">I am deeply grateful to my colleague, Richard M. Haywood, of Purdue University. We became friends while doing research in the Soviet Union. He shared his knowledge of the building of the St.&#160;Petersburg–Moscow Railway and the personalities involved long before the materials appeared in his <span class="CharOverride-1">Russia Enters the Railway Age, 1842–1855</span> (1998). It was also comforting to be able to dine and converse with him and his wife, Piroška, all those cold winter nights.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-US">From the moment I approached the Interlibrary Loan Services (ILL) at Simon Fraser University, the then-head, Sylvia Bell, provided outstanding help, especially in borrowing Russian materials from Russia and Finland, as indeed did every ILL head who succeeded her: Marjorie Nelles, Todd Mundle, Elaine Fairey, Gwen Bird, Scott McKenzie, and Donald Taylor. Alexandra Wawrzyszko-Zielinski provided them with her expertise in Slavic languages and as a bibliographer. Christine Manzer did exemplary work borrowing printed materials for my book while a member of the ILL staff as well as outstanding detailed research in a private capacity for many years, and prepared the list of acknowledgments. Other staff in ILL were also very helpful in various ways: Jannie Swint translated from Dutch; Nancy Blake and Ioana Liuta both capably took over borrowing when their predecessors left ILL; Margo Dykstra bought museum catalogues for me while in Holland; Ian Fell and Anna Raasveldt delivered and retrieved loan materials to and from my home.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-US">Much of my research in Leningrad was carried out in the Central State Archives of the USSR, where I was assigned to work with Agnessa Mukhtan, a generous and knowledgeable archivist, whose help extended to retrieval of materials otherwise unavailable because they were in a part of the building under repair. At the Leningrad Institute of Railway Transport Engineers (LIIZhT),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> with which I was officially affiliated, I&#160;received uncomplicated access to both manuscript and difficult-to-obtain printed materials through the graciousness of the vice-rector, Irina Fadeeva. I also received personal attention from her colleague, Gennadii Afonin, who escorted me every day to and from LIIZhT during the snows of winter. Also at LIIZhT, Marina Pereborova facilitated superb hotel accommodations. At the State Hermitage, Elizaveta Renne, curator of British and Scandinavian Painting, smoothed my access to the Hermitage Archives, paintings in storage, permission for photocopying, and permission to publish photographs of works of art. At the State Russian Museum, Evgenia Petrova, deputy director, arranged access to archival materials concerning Karl Briullov, including his caricatures. At the State Tret’iakov Gallery in Moscow, Lidia Iovleva, deputy director of the Academic Department, arranged for me to meet various staff members of the Manuscript Division. There, Natalia Priimak was especially helpful in contacting staff by telephone at many other archives for immediate answers to my questions. Galina Andreeva, today head of Research and Projects, generously spent time conversing with me about Whistler’s drawing teacher, Aleksandr Koritskii, and arranged for me to receive slides and photographs of works of art. Vitold Petiushenko, research director of the State Tret’iakov Gallery, gave permission to publish a caricature of Koritskii by Briullov. At Pushkin House, Vadim Stark took me on a tour of the Whistlers’ St.&#160;Petersburg. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-US">At the Library of Congress, I am deeply grateful to Robert Allen and David Kraus of the European Division, Charles Kelly of Special Collections, and Grant Harris, present head of the European Division, for quick and easy access to all the materials I wished to see – including unpublished, uncopyrighted material – and the research aid of interns. At the New-York Historical Society, I am deeply grateful to librarian Mariam Touba for her expert knowledge of the manuscript collection, and appreciated her voluble concern over readers’ treatment of book and manuscript spines. Later, I profited by her years of correspondence, identifying persons, places, and events connected with New York in the 1840s.</p>

			<p class="Body-Text" lang="en-US">Not least, I wish to express my undying gratitude to my editor, Karyn Huenemann (Vancouver, BC) for her willingness to undertake this enormous and complicated project and to give it orderliness and shape, all with humor, patience, and an appreciated low-decibel level of discussion, much of our mutual effort accomplished over the telephone and by courier during the COVID-19 crisis.
