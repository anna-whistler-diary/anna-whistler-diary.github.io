			<p class="Body-Text">Aleksandr Osipovich Koritskii (also spelled “Karitskii” and pronounced “Kahrítskee”) was born in 1818 (see <a href="images_7.html#image167" target="_blank">Images 167–170</a>). His father, descended from Polish gentry, was a Catholic, and Koritskii was raised as a Catholic.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> He was the son of Nadezhda Gustavovna (Rudol’f) Koritskaia (d. after 8–9 / 20–21 February 1866)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> and Osip Ivanovich Koritskii (1/13 January 1778 – 3/15 August 1829). His father was a lieutenant colonel in the Corps of Transport Engineers and from 1823 until his death director of the Vyshnii Volochek navigation system.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> Koritskii had a sister, Ekaterina Osipovna, who attended the Smol’nyi Institute for the Education of Young Noblewomen<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> (see <a href="images_6.html#image147" target="_blank">Image 147</a>) and married Pavel Adol’fovich Meingard (Meinhardt) (St.&#160;Petersburg 1812 – Yaroslavl’ 1878),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> also a transport engineer.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> From 1824 to 1828, Koritskii’s father supported within his household the Shtukenberg (Stuckenberg) family, relatives in straitened circumstances: his wife’s sister, Maria Gustavovna (Rudol’f) Shtukenberg (c. 1795 – 25 October / 6 November 1841); the sister’s husband, Ivan Fyodorovich Shtukenberg (d. 9/21 May 1856); and their children. It was through this aunt that Koritskii first became interested in drawing. His interest was further reinforced through the friendship of his first cousin, Anton Ivanovich Shtukenberg (1816–1887; see <a href="images_9.html#image250" target="_blank">Image 250</a>),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> with Nikolai Dmitrievich Bykov (1812–1884), Shtukenberg’s brother-in-law, who worked at the Academy as a supervisor/tutor (<span class="CharOverride-1">guvernyor</span>)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> and eventually became a famous art collector.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> Bykov lived at the Academy, and Shtukenberg and Koritskii, who were inseparable friends, frequently visited him. When Koritskii became a student at the Academy, some of the time he lived in Bykov’s apartment.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In August 1832, Koritskii was accepted as a cadet by the Institute of Transport Engineers, to be educated at state expense. He attended the Institute for some six years and was made a sub-ensign in July 1837.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> However, he had little enthusiasm for study, disliked mathematics particularly, and loved drawing.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> As a result, he left the Institute without graduating and in July 1838, after passing the examination, entered instead the Construction Division of the Main Administration of Transport and Public Buildings, with the rank of ensign.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> A few days after transferring, he was appointed to the Main Administration and attached to art institutions (<span class="CharOverride-1">khudozhestvennye zavedeniia</span>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">According to Shtukenberg, Koritskii began to attend the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in 1838 as an external student.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> In 1839, he was listed as a student in the battle scene class taught by Professor Aleksandr Ivanovich Zauerveid (Sauerweid) (1783–1844).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> He had attracted Zauerveid’s attention through a small painting he had executed, which was presented to Nicholas I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> to whom, as Grand Duke, Zauerweid had taught drawing.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> On 7/19 September 1840, Koritskii, explaining that he had “completed the course of study at the Institute of the Transport Corps,” petitioned the Council of the Academy to permit him to become an external student in order to devote himself “in the hours [he had] free from work … to the study of history and portrait painting under the direction of Professor Briullov and for this purpose to attend the art classes of the Academy,” for admission to which he submitted “a study for a painting from life.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> He indicated that he had already taken courses in architecture, descriptive geometry, theory of shading, and perspective.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> He was accepted and became a student of Karl Pavlovich Briullov (1799–1852; see <a href="images_7.html#image173" target="_blank">Image 173</a>),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> the most influential Russian painter of his day and the best known outside of Russia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In December 1841, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> On 28 April / 10 May 1842, the curator of the Imperial Hermitage, Frants Ivanovich Labenskii (1769–1850), was petitioned to grant permission and a ticket to Koritskii to copy paintings in the Hermitage (see <a href="images_6.html#image113" target="_blank">Image 113</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> In September/October 1842, he received a large silver medal in the category of history and portrait painting for his <span class="CharOverride-1">Diogenes in a Barrel</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Diogen v bochke</span>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> In 1843, he submitted a study for a larger work to be executed in fulfillment of the program set for the small gold medal in history painting; the subject assigned him was <span class="CharOverride-1">Orpheus Leading the Shade of Eurydice Out of Hell</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Orfei, vyvodiashchii iz ada ten’ Evridiki</span>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> His study received the approval of the Council of the Academy to proceed.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In September/October 1843, the Council of the Academy, taking into consideration the progress Koritskii had made in history painting, moved to obtain Imperial permission for him to be released from the Construction Division of the Main Administration of Transport and Public Buildings, “so that he might perfect himself in painting, for which he has a decided gift.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> But the Council’s request met with refusal on the grounds that, because Koritskii had received his education at state expense, he was required to serve for no less than ten years in his department and did not have the right to transfer to another kind of service.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> In November/December 1843, Koritskii was listed among those students of the Construction Division of the Main Administration of Transport and Public Buildings who were given the civil rank of county secretary (12th grade), the equivalent of sub-lieutenant in the Army.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> He was appointed architect’s assistant in the drafting section of District IV of the Board of Transport.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> Beginning in 1843 and continuing until 1847, he assisted Briullov in his work on the cupola frescos for St. Isaac’s Cathedral (see <a href="images_6.html#image121" target="_blank">Images 121–124</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> His domicile was registered in 1844 and 1845 as Bykov’s apartment at the Academy.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Koritskii was one of a few students who were close to “Karl the Great.”span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033b-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033b">33b</a></span></span> He worked for Briullov from 1843 until the latter’s departure from Russia in May 1849 on a year’s leave of absence.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> Yet, despite the fact that “he lived a very long time with Briullov,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span> Koritskii did not write the memoir of him, and therefore of himself, that posterity would have liked. Shtukenberg blamed this on his procrastinating nature: “I could say a lot more about [Briullov] that I heard from Koritskii, whom I always upbraid for not writing down what he knows about his great teacher; but it’s hard to coax him into action.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span> There are extant only some brief daily notes Koritskii kept for the years 1843–1847 that show how extensively he worked for and took care of his ailing mentor. In these few pages, he noted the work of Briullov and his students in and for St. Isaac’s Cathedral, gave information important for dating some of Briullov’s works, and kept a record for the doctors of the dosages and kinds of medications he administered to Briullov.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> Most information about the relationship between Koritskii and Briullov, therefore, has to be sought in the memoirs of other Briullov students, where it is also not copious.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Briullov had a spacious apartment–studio decorated almost entirely in red on the first floor of the Academy facing the Neva.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> Those students closest to him were constantly in his studio, because he felt that the best course of study for them was to observe their teacher at work.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> They also participated in this work, being taught how lacquer and paints are made and how the ground of the canvas is prepared.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> Koritskii prepared the palette for Briullov when the latter, now seriously ill, decided to paint a self-portrait in April 1848.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-041">41</a></span></span> Briullov, while executing the main figures in his <span class="CharOverride-1">The Fountain of Bakhchisarai</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Bakhchisaraiskii fontan</span>) (dated 1849, but begun several years earlier), delegated Koritskii to paint the surroundings, such as the fountain, plants, and furniture.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-042">42</a></span></span> Koritskii and another student, Il’ia Ivanovich Lipin, worked extensively on the cartoons for Briullov’s St. Isaac’s Cathedral frescos.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-043">43</a></span></span> Briullov also required his students to copy his own paintings as part of their training.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-044-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-044">44</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Some of Briullov’s students visited the Hermitage collections with him,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-045-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-045">45</a></span></span> where he would expound to them on works by the great Western masters.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-046-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-046">46</a></span></span> They often read to him when he was working.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-047-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-047">47</a></span></span> An insomniac, he would send for one of them to come read to him at night as well, sometimes for hours, exhausting them but exposing them to interesting literature.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-048-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-048">48</a></span></span> He spoke to his student, Apollon Nikolaevich Mokritskii (1810–1870), in 1837 of his intention of setting up evening classes for them all in his apartment, where they could discuss subjects essential to an artist’s development and give him their opinions on various topics. Each student would then have to express his individual ideas in drawings executed on the spot.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-049-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-049">49</a></span></span> It is said that some of them attended with him the famous “Wednesdays” of his writer and journalist friend, Nestor Vasilievich Kukol’nik (1809–1868), where they saw celebrated literary, artist, and theatre figures.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-050-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-050">50</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Briullov tyrannized these students, playing merciless tricks on them.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-051-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-051">51</a></span></span> One form this joshing took was caricature, and for a long time Mokritskii and academician Filipp Osipovich Budkin (1806–1850) were the butt of Briullov’s caricatures: “then Briullov set upon … Koritskii and gave himself full rein making fun of him. He did not leave a single circumstance of his life without comment,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-052-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-052">52</a></span></span> depicting him, for example, at the easel, as a cupid, painting the interior of St. Isaac’s Cathedral, taking a shower, dancing with girls (see, for example, <a href="images_7.html#image169" target="_blank">Images 169–170</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-053">53</a></span></span> Briullov also executed two portrait heads, both said to be of Koritskii: one a pencil sketch of his head facing front, bent forward and looking down (see <a href="images_7.html#image167" target="_blank">Image 167</a>); the other an unfinished watercolor, left profile.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-054">54</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In March/April 1844, it was moved by the Academy Council that Koritskii be permitted to carry out the program for the small gold medal in the category of history painting on the subject of <span class="CharOverride-1">Mercury Putting Argus to Sleep</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Merkurii usypliaet Argusa</span>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-055-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-055">55</a></span></span> In January 1845, he was awarded a small silver medal for a drawing from a live model, which he executed at the triannual examination on 23 December 1844 / 4 January 1845.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-056-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-056">56</a></span></span> In March/April 1845, he presented his study on the subject assigned to him in the program set for the small gold medal in the category of history painting: <span class="CharOverride-1">Vulcan Forging the Arms of Achilles in the Presence of Thetis</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Vulkan kuet oruzhie Akhillesu v prisutstvii Fetidy</span>) (see <a href="images_7.html#image172" target="_blank">Image 172</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-057-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-057">57</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Some time between September 1844 and April 1845, Koritskii also began to give private drawing lessons to James Whistler<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-058-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-058">58</a></span></span> (see <a href="images_1.html#image24" target="_blank">Images 24–29</a>) and continued to do so until James left St.&#160;Petersburg in June 1848. Why he was chosen as James’s private drawing teacher can only be a matter of conjecture because of the hiatus in Anna Whistler’s diaries from September 1844 until March 1845. He and Major Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image7" target="_blank">Images 7–8, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>) could have met as a result of their both being employed by the Main Administration of Transport and Public Buildings, but the difference in their positions might have precluded that. It is possible that it was Shtukenberg through whom the arrangement was made. Shtukenberg was in charge of building the section of the railroad extending 36 miles eastward from Vyshnii Volochek, and Major Whistler stayed with him when inspecting that portion of the railway line. Whether Major Whistler discussed with him James’s interest in drawing cannot be ascertained from Shtukenberg’s memoirs, but it seems natural that personal subjects should have come up because the memoirs show that the two men had a good relationship.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-059-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-059">59</a></span></span> As Koritskii was Shtukenberg’s close relative and an advanced student at the Academy, he would have been a likely candidate for Shtukenberg to propose to Major Whistler. The story of the relationship of Koritskii and James and the hero-worshipping attachment James felt for Koritskii has already been told in the <a href="james.html">biography</a> of James in “The Whistlers as They Were in the 1840s.”</p>

He graduated from the Institute of the Corps of Transport Engineers in 1836 with the rank of lieutenant and was sent to Eastern Siberia, where he spent four years exploring the Transbaikal Mountains and carrying out preliminary surveys of the Krugobaikal Road. In 1842, he was appointed to carry out investigation and then to be in charge of the section of the St.&#160;Petersburg–Moscow Railway being built between the stations of Vyshnii Volochek and Kalashnikov. Beginning in 1851, he served for four years as director of the completed and operational section from the Okulovka station to Bologoe. In 1855, he was sent to the Crimea, where for two years he built military roads. In 1865, he was made a member of the Technical and Construction Committee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and in 1873 senior mechanical engineer at the St.&#160;Petersburg Municipal Council Governing Board. He remained in these two posts until his death. His writing career began in 1857 and included published biographical essays on both his father, Ivan Fyodorovich Shtukenberg, a well-known hydrographer and engineer-statistician, and his uncle, Aleksandr Osipovich Koritskii’s father; technical articles; and poetry.

He received a separate salary for each of these two duties (Kondakov, <span class="CharOverride-1">Iubileinyi spravochnik</span>, vol. 1, p.&#160;169). The Statute of 1830 made clearer his first duty by qualifying that the tutor was a supervisor (<span class="CharOverride-1">nadziratel’</span>) (Kondakov, p.&#160;181). One person in the group of supervisors was assigned to serve as the class inspector’s assistant (Kondakov, p.&#160;181). He might also teach Russian or French (Kondakov, p.&#160;181). In the Statute of 1840, the word “tutor” was replaced by “supervisor,” and there were no teaching duties, because the general education school at the Academy had been eliminated (Kondakov, p.&#160;187).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-009"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009-backlink">9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolai Dmitrievich Bykov (1812–1884) came from the family of a Petersburg civil servant. He was an external student at the Academy, where he was the pupil of the portrait painter, A.G. Varnek (Warneck) (1782–1843). In 1835, he received the title of non-class artist in portrait painting. In his younger days, he was a supervisor/tutor at the Academy, which both enabled him to get to know many artists who later became famous and awakened his interest in collecting works of art. He married Klara Ivanovna Shtukenberg, sister of Anton Ivanovich Shtukenberg and first cousin of Aleksandr Osipovich Koritskii. He eventually came into a large fortune, which made it possible for him to become an art collector, in which pursuit he showed exceptional taste and knowledge. His magnanimity was well known to students of the Academy, to whom he gave financial aid. He was an honorary free associate (<span class="CharOverride-1">pochotnyi vol’nyi obshchnik</span>) of the Academy and an actual member of the Society for the Encouragement of Artists. He was also a member (<span class="CharOverride-1">glasnyi</span>) of the St.&#160;Petersburg City Duma. At his death, he held the civil service rank of actual state councilor (4th grade).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">Bykov obtained many interesting pieces from the heirs of the sculptor, B.I. Orlovskii (1796–1837), who executed the figure of the angel for the Alexander column, and from the collector, Count A.I. Musin-Pushkin (1744–1817). He gradually amassed paintings by both Russian (Varnek, Venetsianov, Shchedrin, Basin, Briullov) and foreign (Rubens, Guido Reni, Murillo, Holbein the Younger, Pieter de Hooch) masters. The journal <span class="CharOverride-1">Rossiia</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Russia</span>] wrote that “this foreign portion of [Bykov’s] gallery is extremely rich, and hardly any other private collection in Russia can compare with it in terms of the gems it contains. A good half of it can and ought to embellish the Hermitage.” The collection was characterized not only by paintings but also by drawings, watercolors, engravings, and etching plates, as well as by letters and memoirs for biographies of nineteenth-century Russian artists.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">After Bykov’s death, the collection passed to his heirs. A substantial portion of it – seventy-six paintings – was put up for auction at the Society for the Encouragement of Artists in October 1884. Twenty-four pictures were sold. A significant portion of these was acquired by P.M. Tret’iakov (1832–1898). The majority of the paintings, however, remained in the hands of Bykov’s relatives and eventually found their way into museums.</p>

			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-022"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022-backlink">22</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl Pavlovich Briullov (originally Brudeleau) (12/23 December 1799 – 11/23 June 1852) was the son of an artist descended from Huguenots (John Bowlt, ed., <span class="CharOverride-1">The Art of Russia 1800–1850</span> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Art Gallery, 1978), pp.&#160;50–51). He received his early art training at home from his father, whose field of expertise was ornamental wood carving. Briullov entered the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in 1809 and graduated in 1821 as a pensioner, with the privilege of further study abroad. The Academy was unable to send its pensioners abroad because of a lack of funds, but in 1822 the privately established Society for the Encouragement of Artists gave Briullov a fellowship to study in Italy. He remained there, chiefly in Rome, from 1823 to 1834. While in Italy, he painted portraits in oil and watercolor of prominent Italians and Russians, a genre he had begun to work in while still in St.&#160;Petersburg and would continue to work in all his life. His most famous painting of this period, however, was the historical painting <span class="CharOverride-1">The Last Day of Pompeii</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Poslednii den’ Pompei</span>) (1830–1833) (in the State Russian Museum), which has been called “comparable in its kind to Géricault’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Raft of the ‘Medusa’</span> or Delacroix’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Massacre at Chios</span>” (Bowlt, <span class="CharOverride-1">Art of Russia</span>, p.&#160;32) (see <a href="images_8.html#image204" target="_blank">Images 204–205</a>). The overwhelming success of the painting resulted in Briullov’s election to the academies of Bologna, Florence, and Parma (he was already a member of the Academy of Milan) (Atsarkina, <span class="CharOverride-1">Briullov</span>, pp.&#160;94, 129; Bowlt, <span class="CharOverride-1">Art of Russia</span>, p.&#160;47). The painting was also awarded the first gold medal at the Paris Salon of 1834 (Atsarkina, <span class="CharOverride-1">Briullov</span>, p.&#160;132). In the late autumn of 1835, after taking part in an expedition to Greece and Turkey, Briullov returned to Russia, recalled by Nicholas I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>). In late May 1836, he arrived in St.&#160;Petersburg, where he was appointed a junior professor (senior in 1846) at the Academy and was put in charge of the class in history painting (Atsarkina, p.&#160;177). Briullov attempted a second historical painting, this time on a Russian subject, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Siege of Pskov</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">Osada Pskova</span>) (1839–1843), but did not complete the work. He proposed doing mural paintings on subjects from Russian history in the Winter Palace, which was being restored after the fire of 1837, but was turned down by Nicholas I (Atsarkina, p.&#160;187). In January 1839, he married Emilia Timm, an accomplished pianist. The marriage ended in divorce at the year’s end (Atsarkina, pp.&#160;239, 241, 509). Briullov hoped to decorate the ceiling of the dome of the Pulkovo Observatory with a monumental painting, but again the emperor did not give his permission (Atsarkina, p.&#160;188). In 1843, Briullov was invited to take part in the decoration of the interior of St. Isaac’s Cathedral and was assigned to paint the ceiling frescos (Atsarkina, pp.&#160;188, 190). During this period, he also painted some of his best portraits (about eighty), although a large number remained unfinished. Many of them reflect his talent for capturing the sitter’s spiritual qualities (Atsarkina, p.&#160;206). In 1847, Briullov’s heart condition necessitated his withdrawal from the St. Isaac’s Cathedral project. He left St.&#160;Petersburg on 9 May 1849, traveling through Poland, Prussia, Belgium, and England, from where he was to sail for Portugal and thence to the island of St. Catherine near Brazil. However, he changed his mind and from Portugal went instead to Madeira, where he lived for about a year. He next traveled to Spain and then settled in Rome in the spring of 1850. He died on 23 June 1852 in the town of Marciano, and is buried in the cemetery of Monte Testaccio in Rome.</span></p>

In January 1845, Liubov’ Stepanovna Borozdna-Voeikova (1813–1894), a young woman who had been Briullov’s student in 1834–1835 in Rome, came to St.&#160;Petersburg with her mother. She remained there until at least mid-May of that year and met frequently with Briullov. She also visited his studio a number of times when he was not present, approved of by him, as otherwise he insisted that visitors not be allowed. One of the works she examined was the almost-completed <span class="CharOverride-1">St. Alexandra Being Assumed into Heaven</span> (see <a href="images_16.html#image453" target="_blank">Image 453</a>), painted in memory of the deceased Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna (see <a href="images_15.html#image434" target="_blank">Images 434, 444, 451</a>). Borozdna-Voeikova’s letters are interesting as well, because there are no entries for January–mid-April 1845 in Anna Whistler’s diaries. Briullov is depicted as being in a bad humor a good part of the time. Although no mention is made of Koritskii by name, the letters, in referring to Briullov’s work on the cupola of St. Isaac’s Cathedral, mention that alongside him were working two officer–artists. One of them had to be Koritskii. There are also interesting accounts of her copying a Van Dyke in the Hermitage at Briullov’s suggestion and of Briullov’s ice-cold, messy studio (Tsentral’nyi gosudarstvennyi arkhiv literatury i iskusstva (TsGALI) [Central State Archive of Literature and Art], Moscow: Fond 707, op. 1, d. 22.

Their range of subject may be seen in at the easel (inv. no. 100), with a cupid (inv. no. 99), painting the interior of St. Isaac’s Cathedral (inv. no. 2260), before the easel (inv. no. 2216), taking a shower (inv. no. 2216), reading in bed (inv. no. 2216), as a figure with a tail (inv. no. 96), dancing with girls (inv. no. 2215), in profile (inv. no. 2215), seen from the back (inv. no. 2215), sitting at a table (inv. no. 97), bandaging a body part of Briullov’s (the name of the body part said by Atsarkina to be illegible) (inv. no. 89). I have seen these caricatures. The illegible word is “fontaneli,” the Russian medical term for “blistering” (Maria Kamenskaia, <span class="CharOverride-1">Vospominaniia</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Memoirs</span>] [Moscow: Khudozhestvennaia literatura, 1991], pp. 181, 356n12; originally published in <span class="CharOverride-1">Istoricheskii vestnik</span> 1 (1894): pp. 1 –10, 12). Kamenskaia was the daughter of Fyodor Petrovich Tolstoi (1763–1873), a famous artist–medalist and vice-president of the Academy of Fine Arts (1828–1859) (Kamenskaia, p. 6). A doctor friend of her father’s living in the country had purportedly given himself second-degree burns on all his limbs and felt that he had thereby rendered himself immune to catching cholera from his infected patients, whom he handled with bare hands. See also AWPD, Part II, note 540. In a number of the caricatures, Koritskii’s face is covered with heavy stubble and he has a dark spot on the left side of his brow that suggests a mole or a wart.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">There are also several caricature portraits extant (GRM OR: inv. nos. 2217, 106, 28900; inv. no. A-4714, Gosudarstvennyi literaturnyi muzei Otdel rukopisei [State Literary Museum Manuscript Division], Moscow). Not all are dated, but the period in which they were executed ranges from 1843 to 1848 (Atsarkina, <span class="CharOverride-1">Briullov</span>, pp.&#160;418, 419, 428, 436, 441).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-054"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-054-backlink">54</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sketch, dated 1846, is in the State Tret’iakov Gallery (see <a href="images_7.html#image167" target="_blank">Image 167</a>). The unfinished watercolor portrait head said to be of Koritskii, from the period 1843–1847, is in the collection of the State Russian Museum (inv. no. 16017, yellowish paper, graphite pencil, watercolor, 20 x 26.5 cm) (Atsarkina, <span class="CharOverride-1">Briullov</span>, p.&#160;472). While not described by Atsarkina as caricatures, these two portraits have been called such by others (V.M. Petiushenko, academic secretary of the State Tret’iakov Gallery, in his letter of permission to publish their sketch of Koritskii; O. Liaskovskaia, <span class="CharOverride-1">Karl Briullov</span> [Moscow–Leningrad: Iskusstvo, 1940], p.&#160;177), who use the Russian word “sharzh” to describe them (Atsarkina, <span class="CharOverride-1">Briullov</span>, p.&#160;174). “Sharzh” refers to a caricature of a person, but is gentler than “karikatura,” which may be a caricature of a person or a scene. I disagree that the sketch is a caricature. It resembles, rather, the drawing of the head of a man in the Hermitage attributed to the school of Donatello (Nikolai Makarenko, ed., <span class="CharOverride-1">Khudozhestvennye sokrovishcha I`mperatorskogo Èrmitazha Kratkii putevoditel’</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Art Treasures of the Imperial Hermitage: A Brief Guide</span>] [Petrograd: Obshchina Sv. Evgenii, 1916], p.&#160;223). I do not think the unfinished watercolor portrait head is of Koritskii. On the card in the catalogue it says only: “A rosy-cheeked smiling man, with his eyeglasses pushed up on his forehead. Shown waist length, in left profile.”</span></p>

She does not mention his surname, Koritskii, until more than a year later (entry for Saturday afternoon. May 30th [1846], NYPL: AWPD, Part II). Unless one already knew, it could be difficult to deduce from these two entries that they refer to the same person, given the turnover in the Whistlers’ tutors.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">If those who have had access to the manuscript of the diaries might fail to deduce this, how much more difficult the task of Russian scholars, who had no access to it. Their success in identifying Koritskii as James’s drawing teacher came to depend on the extent of their access to Western secondary sources. The topic of young James Whistler in St. Petersburg was taken up in Russian art historical literature in 1928, when the art historian, Erikh Fyodorovich [Bakh] Gollerbakh (Tsarskoe Selo 23 March 1895 – Moscow 1945), published an article entitled “Pevets zhemchuzhno-golubykh dalei” [“The Singer of Pearly Pale Blue Distances”] (<span class="CharOverride-1">Vestnik znaniia</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Harbinger of Knowledge</span>] 21–22 [1928]: pp. 1039–1041) for the twenty-fifth anniversary of Whistler’s death. The manuscript of the article shows that Gollerbakh had called it simply “Uistler v Peterburge” (“Whistler in Petersburg”), and that it differed considerably from the published article in length and text (GRM OR: Fond 32, ed. khr. 81. E.F. Gollerbakh. “Uistler v Peterburge” [E.F. Gollerbakh, “Whistler in Petersburg”], fols. 18–19). Gollerbakh referred only briefly to Anna Whistler’s diaries, “which do not exist in a Russian translation” (Gollerbakh, “Uistler v Peterburge,” fol. 18), but did not say from what source he knew of them. Later he wrote an extensive article (unpublished) entitled “Dzhems Uistler i Akademiia Khudozhestv” (“James Whistler and the Academy of Fine Arts”), in which he explained that he had now been able to consult a French translation of the Pennells’ biography of Whistler (<span class="CharOverride-1">James McNeill Whistler, sa vie et son oeuvre</span>. Tradui et adapté de l’ouvrage original de E. et J. Pennell [Paris, 1913]) (GRM OR: Fond 32, ed. khr. 81. E.F. Gollerbakh, “Dzhems Uistler i Akademiia Khudozhestv” [“James Whistler and the Academy of Fine Arts”], fol. 2). In this way, he was able to draw upon the extensive excerpts they quoted, which had been copied for them from Anna Whistler’s diaries by her step-niece, Emma W. Palmer, for their chapter on St. Petersburg (Emma W. Palmer to E.R. Pennell, Stonington, Sept. 25th [1906], Letters Relating to Whistler, LC: P W, box 296). However, the diary entries in which Koritskii was actually named had not been copied out for the Pennells, so Gollerbakh did not know who Whistler’s private drawing teacher was. In fact, the information about the “young officer” puzzled him, and he confused him with James’s teacher at the Academy. For this and other reasons, Gollerbakh “Dzhems Uistler” contains many errors. For Gollerbakh’s biography, see Jeremy Howard, “Gollerbakh, Erikh (Fyodorovich)[Bakh],” <span class="CharOverride-1">Grove Art Online</span>, 2003, accessed 13 September 2023.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">In 1970, E. Nekrasova published a translation into Russian of <span class="CharOverride-1">The Gentle Art of Making Enemies</span>, which marked the first appearance of Whistler materials in Russian. In addition to Nekrasova’s introduction and translation of Whistler’s essay, the book contains his biography and a section of quotations from Whistler’s correspondents, critics, friends, and enemies about him in all phases of his life. In this same year, Nekrasova also published a very brief article about young James Whistler (E. Nekrasova, “Uistler v Peterburge” [“Whistler in Petersburg”], <span class="CharOverride-1">Khudozhnik</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">Artist</span>] 1 (1970): pp.&#160;43–45. In both her publications, she erroneously proposed that because a young officer was giving James drawing lessons, and because Pavel Andreevich Fedotov (1815–1852), a student at the Academy, was a young officer, James’s private drawing teacher may have been Fedotov (Nekrasova, <span class="CharOverride-1">Iziashchnoe iskusstvo</span>, pp.&#160;3, 265; Nekrasova, “Uistler v Peterburge,”, pp.&#160;43–44, 45.)</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">A member of “the Finland regiment of the Life-Guard [the Imperial Household troops] stationed in St.&#160;Petersburg,” Fedotov retired from military service in 1844 to “devote himself entirely to art,” having attended classes at the Academy part-time since 1835. He painted oil portraits but also became a well-known painter of satirical contemporary genre scenes. He eventually encountered negative “official” reaction to his satirical works and, as a result of the restrictions placed on them and his ensuing poverty, had a nervous breakdown. He died in a mental hospital at the age of thirty-seven (Bowlt, <span class="CharOverride-1">Art of Russia</span>, pp.&#160;50–51). Nekrasova supports her choice of Fedotov by pointing out that in the winter of 1844–1845 he was twenty-nine years old, had just retired from the army at the rank of captain, was attending the Academy and giving private lessons (Nekrasova, <span class="CharOverride-1">Iziashchnoe iskusstvo sozdavat’ sebe vragov</span>, p.&#160;265). Her choice of Fedotov was plausible, since the Western sources she cited in her notes to the text did not identify Koritskii as James’s private drawing teacher.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">The Russian who correctly named Koritskii as James’s drawing teacher was Valentina Barashkova, a librarian, who in 1983 published an article entitled “Ia khudozhnik i ‘rodilsia’ v Peterburge” [“I Am an Artist and I Was ‘Born’ in St.&#160;Petersburg”] in <span class="CharOverride-1">Iunyi khudozhnik</span> [<span class="CharOverride-1">The Young Artist</span>] 8 (1983): pp.&#160;32–37. She knew that Koritskii was Whistler’s teacher, because she had read a book not yet published when Nekrasova was writing on Whistler: Roy McMullen, <span class="CharOverride-1">Victorian Outsider: A Biography of J.A.M. Whistler</span> (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1973), in which McMullen not only mentions Koritskii but cites a letter of James’s that mentions him (V.

It begins “A. Kop”; the “<span class="CharOverride-0" lang="ar-SA">р</span>” is the Russian equivalent of the English “r.” This is followed by “<span class="CharOverride-0" lang="ar-SA">ицк</span>,” the Russian equivalent of “itsk,” while the last letters (<span class="CharOverride-0" lang="ar-SA">ий</span>) are illegible. Under the signature is a date, also written in Russian, which I read as “1847 <span class="CharOverride-0" lang="ar-SA">Май</span> 17.” Salmina-Haskell, to whom I showed a photograph of the drawing, reads it as “1847 <span class="CharOverride-0" lang="ar-SA">Май</span> 19.” MacDonald says the drawing is “signed illegibly, ‘A [Koritskii] 1847 - March 17.—’” (MacDonald, <span class="CharOverride-1">Catalogue Raisonné</span>, p.&#160;4). She does not, however, explain that the name she gives in brackets is a transliteration of a signature in Russian. Moreover, her interpretation of the month as “March” seems to be based on reading the three-letter Russian word as though it were the English abbreviation “Mar.” In Russian the word “March” is four letters long (<span class="CharOverride-0" lang="ar-SA">Март</span>) while “May” is three. A transliteration would correspondingly be four or three letters long. Since Koritskii wrote his name and the month under the drawing in Russian, it seems likely that he rendered the date in Old Style as well. If so, the New Style equivalent for May 17 would have been May 29, a Saturday; for May 19 it would have been May 31, a Monday. It is recorded in the diaries that Koritskii was in the Whistler home on Saturdays and a Monday.</span></p>
