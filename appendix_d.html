			<p class="Body-Text-2">Alicia accompanied me to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Salisbury. where I went to pay a first visit to my dear young friend, (formerly Anne Cunliffe)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> now the wife of Kingston Salisbury Esq<span class="CharOverride-9U">re</span> She welcomed me most kindly &amp; I rejoiced to see her so comfortably settled. I could only remain a short time with her as the “Achilles” was advertised to sail at twelve at noon; my Sister went on Board with Isabella Johnstone and I. but very soon took leave of us, as preperations were then making for the vessel leaving the Dock. and at a quarter before one we were fairly off. There were a great many Passengers, and also much variety amongst them. There were several Jews, some Turks, a french party, and two very pleasing Russian Ladies with a nice little Girl the Daughter of “M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Handyside”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> (one of the Ladies) the name of her Sister was Miss Henley.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> I am that particular in mentioning them as I. [Isa] learnt in the course of the voyage, that they had met with my Brother, Whistler<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> at M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Laws,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> the English Clergy man at S<span class="CharOverride-9U">t</span> Petersburg, and I was anxious to secure their acquaintance for my Sister Anna Should it be her Lot to reside there. Those Ladies mean to return in Sep<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> God willing. They were very agreeable and informed me, that they were born in Poland, but had lived many years in Russia. they were very Lady like in their manners &amp; appearance, and told me that the Russians were a sociable People! — I felt rather anxious not to be known by any of the Passengers, as I did not intend to visit my friends in Edin<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> or any where else in Scotland, except my aunt at Portobello.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> my visit being specially to her, and I had fixed, that I should not be more than a week absent from my Husband. I soon found, however that I could not long remain incog. as very shortly after we were off from Liverpool, as Isabella and I were walking to &amp; fro, on the Deck, a Lady accosted me as “M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Wellwood”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> I replied <span class="CharOverride-1">that</span>, was my name, but a long time ago, and <span class="CharOverride-1">I</span> said the Lady am “M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> H. Gordon”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> with whom I was very glad to renew my acquaintance, she had with her, “Janet”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> her eldest Daughter a very nice lively, pleasing Girl. she had been introduced to a french Deputy &amp; his wife and a Sister of the latter, &amp; they carried on a most animated conversation in french, in which my young friend Isabella took a part. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> G. and I kept much together, she had lately lost her good Husband,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> and I felt interested in the sad scenes, she had lately witnessed and in much, that had occurred since we last met. <span class="CharOverride-1">She</span>, like myself, had not secured sleeping accommodation, and the Passengers were so numerous, that we were obliged to make the best of such beds as the Stewardess could make up for us. and she kindly agreed that those who wished to be together should be put in the same State room. we remained on Deck as long as it was safe so to do, at night, and we had a variety of amusing &amp; interesting scenes. The Sea was beautifully calm, and we had all great reason to bless God with thankful hearts for his mercies to us. Two sweet little Girls were put on shore by a small Boat at the Isle of Man,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> they were very young travellers to be without protection. I regretted not having known sooner of their being on board, for the Capt<span class="CharOverride-9U">n</span> had found much fault for the Stewardess having taken them at all, as there were no other Passengers for the Island. Their Father came to meet his children, &amp; the little things shed tears, (of joy I doubt not) I was very frightened. the Boat seemed to me to get almost under the Steamer at parting. There were several Boys on board going home for the holidays, and three of them had agreed to order a seperate dinner for themselves &amp; had each a Pint of Sherry &amp; some Porter. which made them so tipsey, that they caused both amusement &amp; regret to many of our party one of them, a very Gentlemanly Boy from Glasgow, declared it sh<span class="CharOverride-9U">d</span> be a lesson to him, never to act in the same way again. I hope he may keep this resolution.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">The time of retiring to rest, at length arrived, and I laughed heartily, when I saw fourteen Beds. put up to the best advantage around a small Cabin about ten feet square and six in addition on the floor of the same apartment. We truly were a merry set, and all seemed disposed to enjoy the change, from our own comfortable homes, one very nice good humoured looking young Lady came down, the last from the Deck, &amp; remarked that she must try to have a little sleep, as she had been travelling for two nights before. She was not long before she put her threat in execution, tho’ her head was very near the Curtain, which supplied the place of a door to our apartment. The two french Ladies, were close to my head &amp; kept chattering to my neighbour Miss Gordon at such a rate, that I was repeatedly obliged to say “taisez vous” to their great amusement. another Lady lay very near the foot of my Bed and as Pillows were scarce, the end of my mattress served in part for that purpose, so that I was afraid of giving her a kick now &amp; then. she however took all in good part. I was not inclined to sleep much, and was somewhat annoyed by toothach. I sat up in bed using remedies, which I had brought with me, and, notwithstanding the pain looked round &amp; smiled upon my sleeping companions, some very quiet &amp; others giving a little snore, in proof of their being really asleep. I did forget myself, long enough to feel quite refreshed, and awoke at 1/2 past three when, first one, &amp; then another began to talk, and in a short time we were all once more on foot and one pair after another, went on Deck. the Morn<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span> was bright and beautiful. The Sun had just risen in full splendor. I was delighted and could not sufficiently, thank God for permitting me to view so glorious a sight the grand scottish mountains soon came in sight, and as we approached to Greenock,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> the Islands and wooded shores were a rich feast to the eyes. oh! it was lovely beyond description, and although the air was not quite clear, still we could see “Ben Lomond,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> Ben Nevis,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> &amp;c &amp;c in the distance towering their lofty heads, and adding to the beauty of the numberless lovely places on each side of the Clyde where stood many a noble looking Mansion, and I trust, where also dwelt many warm kind hearts ready and willing to dispense the good things so bountifully bestowed by an unerring Providence. we reached Greenock about 1/2 past six oClock on friday Morn<span class="CharOverride-9U">g.</span> we found there was not a Train for Glasgow<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> till 1/2 past eight, we therefore proceeded by a small steam boat, and landed safe at Glasgow at ten oClock. we then took leave of our agreeable companions, and M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Maclean,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> (a friend of Alicia’s) kindly assisted us, in looking after our Luggage and we went direct to the Glasgow and Edin<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Station.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> near which, we procured a cup of Coffee &amp; some refreshment, and we went on by the 11 oClock Train. we were placed in the Coach with three very starched looking Ladies (old maids I thought) they seemed too full of self importance to speak to us, they only went a short way with us, and at parting, by way of example, I handed them their parcels, and they were induced to say “much obliged &amp; good morn<span class="CharOverride-9">g</span> a servant and Carriage, were in waiting for Isabella, at Falkirk,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span> and there we parted, with, I believe mutual regret. we had been very happy together and we had very much enjoyed our prosperous voyage &amp; journey.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">Nothing occurred worthy of remark from Falkirk, till we reached the all beauteous City of Edin<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> at twelve oClock, I felt a great deal, on entering it, &amp; driving along Princes Street,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span> I called to enquire about the Carlisle Mail,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span> thinking of my return home, and after obtaining the wished for information I almost immediately, went on to Portobello by a Stage Coach, which was about setting off from the Princes S<span class="CharOverride-9U">t</span> Office. The sun, shone bright and all the well known spots appeared to welcome me to the land of Cakes.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> an old lady and Gentleman were in the Coach with me, they were very civil but did not much interrupt my reverie ‘till we arrived at our destination.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-3">Arrival at Portobello. June 16<span class="CharOverride-9U">th</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">I went immediately to Brighton Crescent,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> all anxiety to see my dear Aunt, but, what was my astonishment on finding the gate locked and no admittance. I sent a Boy over the railing who repeatedly pulled the Bell, without any success. The windows being open, made me feel pretty certain that my aunt had not gone from home. I therefore concluded that the Servant must have gone out which proved to be the case. I tried to obtain assistance from the next House, and there again I met with a disappointment. I was not invited to come in &amp; rest, this I determined not to mention, which, I afterwards found, was a prudent plan as the servants, were not on good terms. In the course of half an hour Catherine<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> appeared, She had been at Market and was much dismayed at my early arrival. She is quite a Meg Merrilee<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> sort of character! as soon as she was aware it was me; she exclaimed, “Bless me, is that you? here already! “What will my Leddie say? she never expected you till the ev<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span>! and you said in your letter it might be late.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">I explained as briefly as possible and begged she would open the Gate, which was not so easily done, with the violent shaking it had experienced, the lock was spoiled &amp; it would not open. at length M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Biggs, came out, and could scarcely be persuaded that it was really me. she was quite shocked to see me so changed for the worse in appearance. “oh! my dear said she, what a reception “to give you after coming so far to see me” “And O. how fat you have grown, alas! I should not have known you” She then brought a small ladder &amp; I tried to get over the rail &amp; had nearly stuck fast It was most ludicrous, I could not refrain from laughing. and was very thankful to be on the ground once more. It was then resolved that a Smith must be got, and my aunt sent Catherine with me to her opposite neighbour “M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ansels”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-041">41</a></span></span> who Cath<span class="CharOverride-9U">ne</span> said was a real Lady. she received me very politely &amp; sent a joiner, who happened to be working for her, to try to force the lock of the Gate. He succeeded, and returned in a short time. I was then very anxious to be off, and in the midst of the excitement, I did not observe how near I was to the Chimney piece, I had taken my shawl off, being exceedinly warm, and in throwing it over my shoulder, it caught a China jar, which fell on the hearth, broken to atoms. I was stunned, and mortified at my own stupidity. The old lady clasped her hands &amp; uttered in great vexation “what have you done? my Dresden China, oh! oh! I expressed my unfeigned regret, in the most civil terms I possibly could, but could not appease my Hostess, till I said I should do all in my power to repair her loss, to which she assented, and I held out my hand in token of kindness, but she curtsied &amp; said good morn<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span> and I was not sorry to lose sight of so uncourteous “a real Leddie.” — I returned to my Aunt, who received me very cordially, and by &amp; bye she asked me what I would have to eat”. “my dinner,” said I, as soon as conven<span class="CharOverride-9U">t</span> “we dine at five oClock” I begged that while I staid it might be rather earlier which was, agreed to. tho Catherine was inclined to rebel, on the score of it not being genteel. My aunt however was really pleased to see me &amp; inclined to humour my fancies. as far as she could. we dined about four oClock, and we were not long, before we began to talk over old stories. and before the ev<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span> was over I heard of many grievances, and of the shocking manner in which nearly, the whole of her own family had treated her. But the relatives of her Husband, had always shewn her the most unremitting kindness and respect. I was glad to make my escape for a little &amp; followed Catherine to a China shop, where I purchased a pair of tall purple glasses for flowers. the best that were to be had, &amp; sent them to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ansel. and she was graciously pleased to accept them, in lieu of her “Dresden China jar”.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">On Saturday Morn<span class="CharOverride-9">g</span> the 17<span class="CharOverride-9U">th</span> of June, I arose from my comfortable Bed, much refreshed after the fatigue of the two preceding days. my aunt resumed her theme, of the ill usage she had met with all her life from her unkind relatives. and she talked much of the immense deal of trouble she had had with the laying out &amp; securing the Sum of two hundred pounds, left to her by M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Hunter,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-042">42</a></span></span> for her own life, &amp; after her decease to her Sister M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Wilkin.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-043">43</a></span></span> <span class="CharOverride-1">I knew</span>, that it was only left in trust to her for the behoof of her Sister &amp; her family and I thought it only right to undeceive her, &amp; tell her how it really was. I did so! she would not credit what I said at first. but when I assured her that I had seen M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Hunters will, &amp; that my Husband also saw it, she was perfectly astonished! &amp; enraged beyond description. and declared she would not rest till she was at the bottom of the whole affair. she was so angry, that I bitterly repented having mentioned it at all. we had a weary day of it. fortunately I had the comfort of hearing from my dear Husband in the ev<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">Sunday 18<span class="CharOverride-9U">th</span> – This was a lovely day, and we spent it very peaceably. I read to my Aunt and to Catherine frequently and as much as was practicable we avoided worldly, &amp; exciting subjects. I did not go to Church, as I did not wish to be known. I thought much of my own dear home, and wished I was again with my Husband. tho’ my Aunt was very kind to me, yet she grieved me by the strange things she was continually saying of others who were, or had been dear to me.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">On monday Morn<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span> — The dreadful theme of M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Hunters Legacy was resumed, and my Aunt gave way to a passion so very violent, stamping her foot, &amp; knocking the table that I was quite alarmed her face was so inflamed, I feared she might have a fit. I offered to write to the Executer, M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Pringle<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-044-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-044">44</a></span></span> for a Copy of that part of the will. I did so, which a little appeased her. my head ached and I told her how poorly she had made me. she was afterwards, more upon her guard. she walked out with me in the afternoon and was extremely pleasant, &amp; most kind to me. On tuesday the 20<span class="CharOverride-9U">th</span> inst. we met about the usual hour of nine at breakfast, I was very happy, having another letter from my dear Husband from Underfield,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-045-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-045">45</a></span></span> &amp; he was very well but M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ainsworth still Invalids. – My Aunt and I continued our old family histories, we seldom agreed in opinion but I took care to be very calm in asserting mine, which I did very candidly.

The day proved very fine, &amp; we went, and were most hospitably received, &amp; I was very glad to be with my good old friend M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Millar<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-053">53</a></span></span> once more. we took tea there &amp; M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> James Millar drove us back to Portobello in the ev<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span> M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r </span>Millar did not know exactly how the Legacy was left.

I did not think her maid Catherine quite approved of her proceedings, she never likes to lose sight of her “Leddy”.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">On Thursday the 22— a letter arrived from M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Pringle confirming my statement, as to the Legacy being entirely for the behoof of M<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span><span class="CharOverride-9U">s</span> Wilkin, so the matter was now at rest only it did not afford satisfaction to M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Biggs. The weather continued beautiful, there was no rain during my stay at Portobello. I had another letter from my dearest Wins<span class="CharOverride-9U">ly</span> but a poor account of the Invalids at Underfield. I had this morn<span class="CharOverride-9">g</span> a most delightful visit from my dear Anna Boswell, &amp; her sweet little daughter Sybella<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-054">54</a></span></span> Bob Scott also came again to see me. I walked with them to the Beach, and saw them off again by the Coach.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">I passed the afternoon with my poor aunt and sorely I was grieved to see her so very unhappy, viewing almost every thing in the worst light. and repeating again and again the even, barbarous treatment she she [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] had received from every member of her family. The hour for my departure at length arrived, and at 8 oClock in the ev<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span> I said good bye to Catherine, and took an affectionate leave of my old Aunt, who I was truly sorry to part with, notwithstanding all. and I lamented leaving her with such an artful evil minded person as her Serv<span class="CharOverride-9U">t</span> in whom she places, implicit confidence. <span class="CharOverride-1">She</span> takes care to blow the coal, &amp; keep her in mind of all she has ever heard against the members of her family who had offended her. It was truly with an undescribable feeling of pity that I left my Aunt in the power of such a person, for evidently she has a great deal to say with her. May the Almighty see fit to renew a right spirit within them I pray. On my arrival at Princes Street, my kind Nephew Bob Scott was waiting for me. I left my luggage at the Coach Office, &amp; went with my good friend to his House 17 Leopold Place he had a nice supper ready for me, we enjoyed a friendly chat till ten oClock when a neat little Carriage drove to the door &amp; took us to the Office where the Mail was to depart from. I went over to Register Street, and saw my old servant Magdalen,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-055-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-055">55</a></span></span> the eldest Daughter of my faithful Old Nanny.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-056-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-056">56</a></span></span> The good Girl was delighted to see me! she has been very fortunate Her Husband keeps an Inn at the east corner of Register Street, his name is Robertson.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-057-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-057">57</a></span></span> It is a large House &amp; well frequented. after having a short but pleasing conversation with her, I returned to the Coach Office to wait for the Mail and at half past ten oClock I got into it, &amp; bade adieu to my kind friend M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Scott, who remained with me to the last —</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-3">The Journey from Edinburgh</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">all the Luggage I had with me, was contained in a Carpet Bag, which I wished to have inside but a Gentleman, who was already in the Coach objected to it; and I thought it best to give way and allowed my Bag to be put into the Boot! I was very glad to see a Lady seated opposite to me. I had been wishing so much that I might have a female Companion during the night. I have much reason to thank God for all his goodness to me! The evening was most lovely. I did not at first feel at all inclined to sleep. But the Lady, told me, she had been travelling for the last two days and all night also from London, she had arrived in Edin<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> at 1/2 past two this day, &amp; was now setting out for London again, and she meant to return to Edin<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> without taking a nights rest at all, she had promised to be back in Auld reekie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-058-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-058">58</a></span></span> by Monday Morn<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span> next if she was alive &amp; well. she was young &amp; her appearance was very interesting. my curiosity was excited about her, from the first hints she threw out of her extraordinary proceedings. — She was of course much worn out with fatigue, as she said, both of body and mind. and I rejoiced to see her, asleep in a very short time. and so was the old Gentleman I was in a very happy mood. delighted to find myself really on my way home again. I mused on the great mercies of Providence on the many causes, I had for thankfulness. I enjoyed the wonderful beauty of the night.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">It was the shortest, in the whole year I seemed to be surrounded by blessings, and I did feel truly thankful to Almightly God who also gave me a cheerful heart, fully to appreciate the mercies bestowed upon me. we picked up another female Passenger who left us at Gala Shiels,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-059-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-059">59</a></span></span> I still felt very wide awake and I had hitherto had no conversation with my more drowsy companions. a Decent looking man came in at Gala Shiels, he did not look very promising for a Companion, but I began to talk to him &amp; I found him very intelligent about the Crops and all Country Matters. The sun rose betwixt three &amp; four oClock and was very magnificent amongst the Hills, I was charmed with the beauty &amp; grandeur of the scenery. But most unfortunately I became very sleepy, just when we came to the prettiest part of the whole road, betwixt Longham and Longtown,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-060-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-060">60</a></span></span> I missed seeing Netherby Hall<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-061-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-061">61</a></span></span> etc I was however greatly refreshed when I awoke; and we got on speedily to Carlisle, where we found a good breakfast awaiting us. I enjoyed mine very much. and after we were seated in the Coach again, we entered into a very animated conversation. The old Gentleman and I became quite good friends, and he asked me if I had forgiven him for not permitting my Bag to be inside with me I assured him I had, tho’ I told him I thought him rather cross at the time. The young Lady before mentioned, was very pensive, &amp; gave us many mysterious hints as to her unfortunate circumstances, she said she scarcely cared what became of her! I advised her strongly to write to inform her friends in Edin<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> that she could not return to them without resting a night in London, as if she did not, the probability was, that she would be very ill, &amp; perhaps never recover, she said then her troubles would be at an end! The old Gentleman enquired which country she was bound for were she to leave this world? and begged her to reflect, that then, she must be either in a state of perfect happiness or misery. And it was too serious a change to be thought lightly of. she sighed deeply and assented to the solemn truth. In the course of conversation, she alluded several times to what, a “M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> Lennox”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-062-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-062">62</a></span></span> had said, and spoke of being at the Opera; and some how or other, I fancied she had something to do with the stage. I said to her I should not be surprised, were I to see her name in the Newspapers. she said it was not impossible. I begged her to write her name in my pocket Book if she had no objection, she at once took the pencil &amp; wrote, “Eliz<span class="CharOverride-2">t</span><span class="CharOverride-9U">h</span> Angel”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-063-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-063">63</a></span></span> and said if I made enquiry I might hear of her in Manchester. I was resolved to do so for my curiosity was great! - as we drew near to Kendal,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-064-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-064">64</a></span></span> my spirits mounted very high I was so delighted at the prospect of seeing my dear Husband &amp; some of our loved friends from Kirkby.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-065-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-065">65</a></span></span> my fellow travellers were greatly amused with me, the old Gentleman said he had never met with a wife who spoke of her Husband with such animated affection. “he surely must be something wonderful! the Sun shone bright. The day was most splendid, and I enjoyed it to the uttermost. we arrived at Kendal about two oClock, and as soon as the Coach stopped I saw my Husband at the door of the Inn!<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-066-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-066">66</a></span></span> he seemed quite well, and I was as happy as any human creature could be.

I felt ashamed of my apparent want of sympathy, for I was so overjoyed. that I could not control my tongue and I talked at the rate of nineteen to the dozen, all the time we were at dinner, and while we remained at the Inn. _ we proceeded to Kirkby to tea, where we had a very joyful meeting with with dear Eliz<span class="CharOverride-9U">th</span> Jane &amp; Isabella &amp; the darling little John.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-069-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-069">69</a></span></span> M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Picard Sen<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span><span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-070-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-070">70</a></span></span> soon joined us. I talked all the ev<span class="CharOverride-9U">g</span>. relating many anecdotes of my weeks visit at Portobello. Not omitting Catherine, telling M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Ansel what a grand Lady I was “daily driving out in my Carriage with four Horses, or six if I thought proper.” — and also the lecture she gave me for never driving her Leddy out, when I was last in Scotland &amp; gratifying her by letting my Carriage stand at her door.</p>

The wills of Mrs. Isabella (Finlay) Clunie, Eliza’s grandmother; Miss Isabel Clunie, Eliza’s aunt; and Mrs. Charlotte (Clunie) Biggs, Eliza’s aunt, offer much clarification of the Clunie family genealogy as well as add some details to the biographies of heirs, lawyers, friends, and executors that Eliza Winstanley heard her Aunt Charlotte Biggs mention. The wills show, for example, the interesting information that neither Mrs. Isabella (Finlay) Clunie nor Isabel Clunie left an inheritance to Alicia Margaret Caroline McNeill (see <a href="images_1.html#image39" target="_blank">Image 39</a>), then in her twenties, but Eliza (McNeill) Wellwood received £1000 from her grandmother, and £10 was allotted to her by her aunt for the purchase of a mourning ring as a memorial of that aunt.</span></p>

She traveled by train from North Union Station in Preston to Edge Hill Station in Liverpool. At Liverpool, she boarded a steamer that stopped at the Isle of Man and then proceeded to Greenock. Because of the lengthy wait that would have been required to take a train from Greenock to Glasgow, she traveled there by steamboat. She then traveled by train from Glasgow to Edinburgh. Here, she traveled by stage coach to the Portobello area to the home of her aunt. Her return journey was by the Carlisle coach from Edinburgh, which made a stop at Galashiels. She ended her solo journey in Kendal and proceeded by coach to Kirkby Lonsdale with her husband and a party of friends, who had come to Kendal to meet her. See <a href="images_3.html#image61" target="_blank">Images 61–70</a>, and <a href="images_3.html#image74" target="_blank">74–75</a> of some of the stops along her journey.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">The North Union Line was opened on 1 November 1838, cutting the travel time from Preston to Liverpool to one-and-three-quarter hours (Hunt, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Preston</span>, p. 198).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-007"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007-backlink">7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliza Winstanley was going to Edinburgh to visit her mother’s sister, Charlotte (Clunie) Biggs (b. Whitekirk, East Lothian 24 July 1762; bap. Whitekirk, East Lothian 30 July 1762; d. Portobello, Edinburgh 9 November 1844) (<span class="CharOverride-1">Glasgow Herald</span>, November 11, 1844). Charlotte Biggs is listed in the 1841 Scottish Census as 70 years old, of independent means, and born in the county. She was the widow of James Biggs (d. Memel 24 March 1806), a British wood merchant of Memel, East Prussia (“At Memel, James Biggs, Esq. formerly of Glasgow,” “Deaths March 1806,” <span class="CharOverride-1">The Scots Magazine and Literary Miscellany</span> 68, no. 1 [1806]). Although in his obituary James Biggs is said to be “formerly of Glasgow,” he seems to have been of English descent. There is no James Biggs born or baptized from 1750 to 1790 listed in the Old Parish Registers for the whole of Scotland. It was not possible to discover his age at death, or location of birth, or confirmation of marriage between him and Charlotte Biggs in Scottish archival materials. In her will, Charlotte Biggs refers to the Knox family, the “kind relatives” of her husband, James Biggs, who Eliza Winstanley mentions in this diary as hearing about from Charlotte Biggs. This may be an avenue of pursuit to learn more about James Biggs. One of the executors of Charlotte’s will, proved on 24 January 1845, was Andrew Lawson Knox, her nephew; perhaps the investigation should begin with him.
