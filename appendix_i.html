			<p class="Heading-2">A Letter from Martha (Kingsley) McNeill and Anna (McNeill) Whistler to Catherine (McNeill) Palmer</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The following letter was written jointly by Martha (Kingsley) McNeill and Anna (McNeill) Whistler to their daughter and sister, Catherine (McNeill) Palmer, on 12 January 1852, some three months before the death (on 7 April) of Martha (Kingsley) McNeill. The opportunity to thus juxtapose the similar styles of their expressions shows clearly how great the moral and religious influence of mother on daughter was. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">This photocopy of portions of the letter and transcription of the complete letter were provided (26 March 1976) by Josephine Caldwell (d. March 1986), great-granddaughter of Charles Johnston and Eliza (Coffee) McNeill. All attempts to locate the originals have been unsuccessful.</p>

			<p class="Body-Text">The following is the transcription of the complete letter provided by Josephine Caldwell. I have indicated, based both on Josephine Caldwell’s comments and on textual content, which parts of the letter were written by Anna Whistler, and which by Marth (Kingsley) McNeill.</p>

			<p class="Salutation">Pomfret, Jan 12, 1852</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Another year has passed and I have allowed as many days of the new to intervene without one line expressive of my heart’s desire for very happy returns to you all, my own dear precious children. Mine, I need not say, would be cheered by, if only one line saying “we are all well” but I will not complain as generally after a long silence, I am amply compensated by one of your highly prized satisfactory accounts of sayings and doings of all your precious ones at home, my own Kate, and who knows what happy tidings this day’s mail will be the bearer of. The parcel sent by John Brookman<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> we know must long since have been received as it was forwarded from Boston immediately, &amp; we hope soon to know of the comforts its contents have afforded our darlings to all of whom say much and give many kisses and good wishes from Aunt Anna and Grandmother. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">We are well but the extreme cold and slippery walking confines me entirely to the house as both back and front are impossible and impossible for me to walk from the door to the gate, had I an offer of riding, and yesterday passed many lonely hours – although comforted with my books from half past ten until three when your sister and Willie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> returned from hearing our good pastor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> and brought two of his sermons (for my good) which the former read with other portions of scripture and prayers which end our days &amp; which pass in sameness from week to week, but we have the comfort in our retirement to ply our needle which brings much to pass &amp; we hope before our great move to effect much and give place to other varieties more conducive to health. Margaret Hill<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> in her last letter says the workmen have promised Anna’s Cottage to be finished by April by which time I suppose all will be in readiness as I hope to be out of the way in March, not in yours, my child I trust, as in various ways I can assist and shall enjoy the society of your pets and the prattle of darling Anna.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> We are enjoying the fine sunshine although very cold and windy but health cheers, and we feel great cause for thankfulness and innumerable blessings.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">I must not forget to mention a very unexpected visit the other day from Mr. Flagg &amp; Eliza<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> who arrived just after our dinner when your sister was busily engaged in the kitchen (Mary B.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> not having returned), I upstairs with my feet in water thinking to ourselves when all is done we will have a quiet comfortable afternoon. Eliza was in high spirits and so was he. They enjoyed themselves until the next afternoon on their way to Danielson Falls<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> where he was engaged to deliver a lecture and promised themselves much happiness in a visit to Brooklyn. Eliza is a bright star in his church where she is quite an intellectual character, is looked up to, and much beloved by his congregation, and a vast favourite of Mrs. Camp<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> who says he loves her best of the two. You will almost doubt when I say what a flattering addition I have to my correspondents in Madam Vinton<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> whose last letter I have just answered. My pleasing anticipations have, to my no small joy, been realized by your last letter, my good child, for which receive my warm thanks. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Willie brought it from the office just as we were going to our dinner which I enjoyed with a double appetite which is always good, and as you sister wishes to add to this, I will resign my pen to her’s more able with the blessing of your affectionate Mother – M. McN.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">This part of the letter was written by Anna (McNeill) Whistler to her sister Kate.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Our hominey<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> has arrived in time as our rice is just out. Our dear Charles<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> was well a short time since and begged love to you and the Doctor<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> who will again receive my dear love.

I trust God will ward off contagion. The only disease I dread is small pox.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Mother, our beloved, has left me to tell you, my dearest Kate, of my children, judging of your interest by my own for yours. Oh, my Sister I unite my earnest thanksgiving with yours to our Father in Heaven that the illness which has increased your winter cares has not lessened your sources of home joys, for while I am but a sojourner, you have the substantial comfort of a settled home; long may it be thus your lot, with a husband to sustain you in the path of duty. Debo’s<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> letter will be more satisfying than aught I can extract. Mrs. Park<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> has ere this the due for taste and neatness in dressing the doll. Tell Emma with my love I hope she will reward you for all your care of her as my precious daughter<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> has ever done, how sacred is the bond between us! She is so kind in the fondest of my memories, of home scenes passed away from me. George<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> is equally dutiful and affectionate, poor fellow! I tenderly sympathize in his anxiety now because of our gentle Mary’s<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> feeble frame of body. He fears she must suffer much, tho he clings to hope that the tender care of her mama may prop her so that she may long be spared to us. Her cough is of the most severe kind, her lungs diseased, and she is thin as a shadow. Her doctor does not speak encouragingly of her ever being stronger. She is confined to warm rooms and cannot make the least exertion without suffering; baby<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> has quite outgrown her care of him. He has his first tooth and is sprightly and firm in health, the joy of Mrs. Ducatel’s<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> whole house. George managed to get to West Point to spend half a day with Jemie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> on the 3rd. Our Cadet had passed the rigid examination creditably so Proff. Bartlett<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> told George. I am expecting Jemie’s expression of thanks for the boxes of ginger snaps (&amp; mince puffs, 3 doz) which I sent him via New Haven. Tho George judges by the bleakness of the plain &amp; Jemie’s having had no overcoat that the soft, warm under-garments received from Aunt Alicia,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> my commission, would be most seasonable It seems until the ”plebes” pass their Jan. exam, they are not provided with military great coats, and of course allowed to wear no other. Ero [Ere] this I doubt not Jemie is rewarded but “Uncle Palmer” will be satisfied that his rheumatic patient has borne the cold without injury to health or limb. Thus far how favored we have been in our share of health. Willie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> is as tall as I am now, and as fat again! Tho he studies till a later hour than formerly since joining an evening class at the Rectory for the chief benefit of those who are preparing for visiting Germany. Willie is the pronouncing dictionary. I am glad on his account for the walk and to refresh his Deutch. As the present school term will be so brief I hope as he does that Uncle Palmers lecture will be deferred till March when Willie looks forward to escorting Grandmother to Stonington. We hope not to be disappointed in dear Georgie’s<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> visit. Cannot he persuade his mother to bring him? O I will hope so, dearest Kate. Your girls will, I am sure, neglect nothing in the home to spare you to the Pomfret circle a week or a fortnight. Mary B. was absent 3 weeks in the coldest weather experienced in 70 years here. Yet I managed nicely. Eliza<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> attends the District school half days and Sunday school She is still a great tax to patience and is subject to the evil spirit but she wishes to overcome her enemy and has improved tho slowly, so I am not discouraged as Mother and Mary are. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">How I should refresh my spirit among your plants (and especially those whom you nurture for a celestial garden! My associations with flowers are sacred). “Charlie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> remembered Aunt Kate” when he reveled in the parterre of Preston. Kirkie<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> cherished every bright leaf to show Grandmother in his last earthly home! Oh, my sister how precious is the promise that tho they cannot come bodily to my embraces, I shall have “little ones” forever thru the perfect work of a Redeemer. I must patiently abide all my appointed time, for I need the refining of the furnace under the daily cross. It seems to me I never knew the evil of my own heart till now, or adored sufficiently the forbearance of our heavenly father. I am one of a bible class of ladies in this church; their expressions of regret at the prospect of my soon being parted from them when we were together yesterday made me feel the value of christian sympathy more than ever. I have been thankful every day in Pomfret and should regret going from it under the prospect of going only among strangers.</p>

It is good to be with them I find. I am hurried this morning to get this ready for the mail. Will your dear children take less interest in their contract for the little boys grave stones if their cousins Jemie &amp; Willie contribute a mite? Do as your excellent judgement approves, dear Kate.
