			<p class="Heading-1">Maps</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The first map shows St.&nbsp;Petersburg in 1844. Following that are three maps showing the house numbers and owners’ names in the environs of the English Embankment and Galernaia Street, exactly as provided in Nistrem’s <span class="CharOverride-1">Adres-Kalendar’ Sanktpeterburgskikh zhitelei</span>.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The English Embankment was located on the left bank of the Neva River, between Isaac Bridge and Galley Wharf. Behind the English Embankment and parallel to it was Galernaia Street, on a corner of which stood the Bobrinskii mansion (see <a href="images_5.html#image88" target="_blank">Images 88–94</a>). The Whistler family lived in this mansion from late September 1843 until May 1844. On the English Embankment opposite the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts stood Ritter’s house. The Whistlers lived in an apartment in this house from September 1844 until May 1849. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The surnames of house owners as supplied by Nistrem appear in the genitive case, because in Russian house + of + surname is understood. I have put these surnames into the Russian nominative case in English transliterations. If the same surname appears for the house on both the English Embankment and Galernia Street, it means that the property occupies the entire lot. If a different surname appears for the house on the English Embankment and Galernia Street, it means that each property occupies a portion of the lot. In some instances – for example, Borg and Borkh – I do not know whether these are two different surnames or a misspelling; in Russian the “kh” is a single letter of the alphabet (“Ʃ”) but does not resemble “g” (“<span lang="ar-SA">г</span>”) in its shape. In instances where the house owner has a foreign surname ending in a consonant – for example, Ritter – only the masculine surname is declined in Russian; the female version of the same surname is not declined. Thus, “Rittera” on the Russian language map indicates that the owner is a man, while “Ritter” indicates that the owner is a woman. This distinction is unwieldy to represent on an English language map, and is unnecessary for my purposes, and so is omitted. I am chiefly interested in the Bobrinskii and Ritter houses. As well, the house numbers provided by Nistrem do not always correspond to the addresses for individuals given in other sources, such as mandatory departure announcements published in the <span class="CharOverride-1">Sanktpeterburgskie vedomosti</span> (<span class="CharOverride-1">St. Petersburg News</span>) so that travelers’ debtors would be apprized. See “<a href="st_petersburg_journey.html">St.&#160;Petersburg and the Journey There</a>” for more details about the Whistlers’ and their neighbors’ residences. </p>

Anna Whistler personally did not wish to have to choose between allegiance to the United States or to England, because she loved both countries. In the case of Mexico, she was distressed that both her husband’s brother and nephew would be called up for active duty. See the entries in Part II of the Diaries for Thursday l0 April [1845] and accompanying Note 69, Friday evening [January] 9 [1846] and accompanying Note 263, July 7 [1846] and accompanying Note 410, and [Saturday] November 14 [1846] and accompanying Notes 565 and 567.</p>
