			<p class="Body-Text">John Stevenson Maxwell (see <a href="appendix_j.html">Appendix&nbsp;J</a>)<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-002"><span id="endnote-002-backlink">2</span></a></span> was born on 18 February 1817 in New York, the son of Agnes (Stevenson) Maxwell (5 January 1796 – New York 27 April 1866; see Image 54) and Hugh Maxwell (Paisley, Scotland 15 June 1787 – New York 31 March 1873; see Image 55) (married in New York 16 April 1812).<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-003"><span id="endnote-003-backlink">3</span></a></span> He was one of four surviving children, the other three being Anne Eliza (New York 1816 – New York 4 May 1888), Hugh (New York 1824 – Saddle River, NJ 23 June 1898), and Agnes (New York 1834 – New York 2 July 1917).</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maxwell was an imposing and strapping specimen of a young man: a brilliant intellectual, well-educated, well-traveled, discerning, informed, cultivated, lively, a perfectionist, irritable, impatient, proud, gossipy, and at times somewhat of a popinjay. He wrote well and eloquently, indeed like an orator, in his letters, providing outstandingly candid sometimes even offensive descriptions of persons, scenes, and events. He was deeply attached to his family. He seemed to like women very much, but spoke of them with a certain tentativeness. He is described in a visa granted in Hamburg on 20 July 1843 as five feet eleven inches tall, with a high forehead, light blue eyes, light brown hair, and having a “common” nose, small mouth, round chin, oval face, and fresh complexion.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-004"><span id="endnote-004-backlink">4</span></a></span> He himself described his hair as a “doubtful” auburn,<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-005"><span id="endnote-005-backlink">5</span></a></span> but at that point in his Middle East travels he looked in general very unkempt, sporting also a moustache and beard. On recovering from his bout of typhus fever in 1844, he described himself to his mother as </p>
			<p class="Quote">stouter and stronger than ever, and so ruddy as to be pronounced on all sides, a perfect specimen of John Bull. I eat and drink very moderately but it is of no use. The principle of life is so strong within me and nature has been so kind in her gifts and physical endowments, that I utterly despair ever becoming your slim and tender man of fashion. I am in truth a most happy compound of the Maxwell and Stevenson, Scotch, stout and strong. My illness upon the whole has been a benefit for my rapid recovery and my present health is an evidence of this.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-006"><span id="endnote-006-backlink">6</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">In contests with young Englishmen he and his traveling companions encountered, he won at lifting, attributing his back strength to the exercise he had had clearing stones from the Ramapo fields at home, but failed at hand-over-hand rope climbing.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-007"><span id="endnote-007-backlink">7</span></a></span> His heftiness is stressed again when he describes that he cannot allow himself to yield to dancing in a warm room or with a fat woman. In Paris, on the way home from his travels abroad, he took dancing lessons from the most famous dance master, Belarius, and learned the polka and the two-step waltz, but considered himself a failure because he simply could not control his sweating. He also took fencing lessons then, only to conclude that he was too old to have the necessary agility.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-008"><span id="endnote-008-backlink">8</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Despite his liveliness, he had a darker side, which he at first alluded to rather cryptically. In his life prior to leaving the United States to take up his position in St. Petersburg, he appears to have on many occasions exhibited extremely bad behavior to family and friends, for in October of 1842 he alluded to such behavior without giving examples of specific instances, and apologized to his mother: </p>
			<p class="Quote">Could I only make you happy. Could I add an hour or a moment of pleasure to your life. Could I repay you for all your kindness and drive forever from my memory the ungrateful and unfortunate conduct of the past I would give the world. If I am now doing so – if by study and care and sincere affection for you and Father and all our friends and family I can do so you need give yourself no further unhappiness on my account. I ask forgiveness of God of you and all and every one whom I may have injured in moments of despondency or dejection and pray to rise superior to and to conquer every manifestation of that unhappy irritation which you have so often noticed and which must have pained you so much.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-009"><span id="endnote-009-backlink">9</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">On New Year’s Day 1843, a time of personal resolutions, he spoke openly of the only malady he felt he had, perhaps inherited from his maternal grandfather: </p>
			<p class="Quote">Sometimes I am in exceedingly good spirits and wish not to be better in mind or body and then again I am oppressed with a most indefinable melancholy or depression which nothing for a time can conquer. It is a weakness, and as such I should not perhaps mention it without the hope or determination to vanquish it, I try to do so and hope to do so, for the idea of suffering from so unpleasant a companion through life is awful indeed. It may be possibly increased by the peculiar atmosphere of these dreary regions, or it may be constitutional, for I know Grandfather Stevenson suffered from something of the kind. Whatever it may be nothing but perfect health of body and plenty of exercise can guard against it and these I wish to secure if possible.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-010"><span id="endnote-010-backlink">10</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">He continues, regretting that he had not years earlier “cultivated my naturally good constitution by a course of manly exercise.” He seems also to have had an unhappy love affair before coming to Russia that made him afraid to be serious about women.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-011"><span id="endnote-011-backlink">11</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He read incessantly from the time he was a child. He attended The Lawrenceville School<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-012"><span id="endnote-012-backlink">12</span></a></span> and graduated from Princeton University in the Class of 1836.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-013"><span id="endnote-013-backlink">13</span></a></span> He received a classical education and his letters, especially from the Mediterranean area, abound in classical allusions.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-014"><span id="endnote-014-backlink">14</span></a></span> He was also well-versed in French and English literature and his letters about his travels in Western Europe and England demonstrate this. He was very scholarly, and, while he enjoyed the companionship in his travels of mercantile young men (Lewis and Thompson), he expressed his preference for the ones (Starke and Rev. Mason) who carried in their coat pockets books in Greek and Latin, as he did.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-015"><span id="endnote-015-backlink">15</span></a></span> He also knew a great deal about artists and theorized on art imitating nature when he visited art collections in all the Western countries he passed through.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-016"><span id="endnote-016-backlink">16</span></a></span> For example, viewing in Rome the neo-classical works of Canova and Thorvaldsen, he commented: “The latter is in many respects my favorite of the two and his bas reliefs are decidedly superior to those of any modern.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-017"><span id="endnote-017-backlink">17</span></a></span> He “pursued the whole term of his professional studies” in law in New York in the office of Elijah Paine (1796–1853).<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-018"><span id="endnote-018-backlink">18</span></a></span> Nevertheless, he felt that he had done nothing in the six years between leaving Princeton and 1842, when he went to Russia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-019"><span id="endnote-019-backlink">19</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He was a colonel in the militia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-020"><span id="endnote-020-backlink">20</span></a></span> He asked his family to get him a commission immediately, if war between the United Stated and Great Britain over the Oregon Territory should be announced, and pointed out that he had been aide-de-camp to Seward and noted: “with a little study I flatter myself I could be of some service.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-021"><span id="endnote-021-backlink">21</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In speaking of Maxwell’s relationships with women, it is necessary to point out that although he asked some of his correspondents to keep his letters, because he planned to publish them, the bulk of his extant letters was addressed to his mother, to whom he described all of his travels and revealed all aspects of his life. In the case of Deborah Delano Whistler, he described her because he was describing the entire Whistler family. He was not writing about a girl he was falling in love with, but a group of people who had made him a member of their family, eventually even saving his life. He honored Major Whistler’s preference that his daughter marry an officer in the United States Army<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-022"><span id="endnote-022-backlink">22</span></a></span> by not himself becoming a suitor. While his mother’s letters are not extant, his responses indicate that she liked what he said about Debo and kept asking for more and more detail, because she wanted him to follow the usual path: to meet a suitable girl, marry her, and produce children. She apparently then passed his enthusiastic comments about Debo on to others, although he had asked her not to, resulting in the rumor of possible matrimonial plans in the Whistler family.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-023"><span id="endnote-023-backlink">23</span></a></span> He wrote to his mother frankly, but with humor, about the women he met, partly to tease her because she must have harped on his finding a wife, whenever he mentioned a woman. He mentioned a woman in Lancashire who had invited him to visit her on his journey home, but decided to tantalize his mother by withholding the woman’s name.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-024"><span id="endnote-024-backlink">24</span></a></span> He jokingly asked Major Whistler whether the latter knew his Russian acquaintance, Agaphia Lubenski, in which case he, Maxwell, would ask him to translate a serenade into Russian and sing it to her some dark night, all totally out-of-keeping with the Major’s temperament and an imposition on his generosity.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-025"><span id="endnote-025-backlink">25</span></a></span> He wrote his mother of the attractiveness of the widowed Mrs. Nichol Baird:</p>
			<p class="Quote">I have enjoyed the society of M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Baird very much … I [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] very fine looking woman she is, very ambitious and as usual with ladies of family in Russia, speaks four languages perfectly. We are in the same Hotel together and the people here think we are of one family travelling party, while some very wicked youngsters are disposed to imagine it is a prize I have carried out of Russia – <span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-026"><span id="endnote-026-backlink">26</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">but controlled himself when writing of the latter to Major Whistler.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-027"><span id="endnote-027-backlink">27</span></a></span> He described to his mother, with evident distaste, the lascivious dancing girls he and his male companions met at one of their stopovers in the Middle East.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-028"><span id="endnote-028-backlink">28</span></a></span> Being a gentleman, he accepted the consignment to him of a single woman, Miss Richardson, traveling alone, even when chaperoning her was inconvenient.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-029"><span id="endnote-029-backlink">29</span></a></span> He also alluded, with feigned consternation, to the fate of a future wife and himself, if Roslyn, which his mother seemed at one point to be losing a taste for, were to be sold.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-030"><span id="endnote-030-backlink">30</span></a></span> Once, with more muted humor, he touched on the future possibility of marriage for himself: </p>
			<p class="Quote">I must find consolation in the fact that I <span class="CharOverride-S">am</span> will arrive at maturity later than most men, that I will live longer and grow wiser and handsomer and better every day. I have never trifled with my health and in this respect if in none other I feel myself worth a dozen of your milk and water gentry affected with premature decay. If I am ever so happy as to have a wife I love, I sometimes flatter myself she will love me, for if I know myself, I promise better for the future than for the present or the past. And then, when a son is mine, bless me, but I’ll make him something or kill him in the effort. Pardon a bachelors anticipations and remember that my fluent flattery is to please ourselves alone.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-031"><span id="endnote-031-backlink">31</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">When Maxwell did marry on 11 June 1853, his bride was eight months pregnant. Their daughter was born on 2 July 1853.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-032"><span id="endnote-032-backlink">32</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Hugh Maxwell’s family emigrated to New York in 1790. He grew up there and graduated from Columbia College in 1810, with an MA in 1816, and became a very successful lawyer. He was district attorney of New York County in 1817–1818 and again from 1821 to 1829. An active member of the Whig Party, in 1849 he was appointed collector of the Port of New York by President Zachary Taylor (1794–1850; see Image 51), a position he held until 1853, throughout the administrations of Taylor (1849–1850) and his successor (1850–1853), Millard Fillmore (1800–1874).<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-033"><span id="endnote-033-backlink">33</span></a></span> John Stevenson Maxwell also considered himself a Whig.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-034"><span id="endnote-034-backlink">34</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">John Stevenson Maxwell’s family lived on Wall Street in New York City, but also had a country estate, called Roslyn,<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-035"><span id="endnote-035-backlink">35</span></a></span> at Nyack-on-Hudson in Rockland County, New York (see “Maps”). Family legend has it that “such distinguished personages from abroad as Thackeray, Victor Jacquemont, the French naturalist, and Dickens were frequently entertained” at Roslyn.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-036"><span id="endnote-036-backlink">36</span></a></span> Writing his mother during his summer tour of Western Europe in 1844, Maxwell recalled, in his entry of July 4th, with deep homesickness “the beautiful young lindens before my Father’s door … on the green shores and bright waters of the Hudson.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-037"><span id="endnote-037-backlink">37</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He was secretary of the American Legation in St.&#160;Petersburg from July 1842 to November 1844. He lived throughout his tour of duty in the house of Count Aleksei Alekseevich Bobrinskii on the corner of Galernaia Street and the New Admiralty Canal (see Images 86–94). When Colonel Charles S. Todd (see Image 278) chose to move the Legation from the Bobrinskii house to Tsarskoe Selo in April 1843, Maxwell and Major Whistler (see Images 7–8, 21) remained in the Bobrinskii house, and, when Major Whistler rented the entire house for his family, Maxwell remained as their tenant. His letters to his mother reveal his respect and deep love for both Major and Anna Whistler (see Images 1–5). While living with them, he became dangerously ill with typhus fever. His life was saved chiefly through the ministrations of Anna Whistler. Having been told by Major Whistler that he would relinquish Debo (see Images 17–19, 21) easily and gladly only to an officer of the United States Army, he limited himself to a platonic attachment to her. He also had a great affection for James (see Images 24–29) and Willie (see Images 27, 30).</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He described his rooms before Major Whistler took over the entire mansion as follows:</p>
			<p class="Quote">My private rooms are two in number – and the Major and myself have two in common to see company etc – Then I have my Chancery which I now write in a large fine room and the office of the legation – His Excellency has all the other rooms of a very large fine house to himself – The whole is delightfully warm so much so that I fear I shall be spoiled as foreigners generally are –<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-038"><span id="endnote-038-backlink">38</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text-2">He also described his day as it was for most of his sojourn in Russia:</p>
			<p class="Quote">I get up about seven (just light now) and take a cold bath (an idea of my own here) dress – read two chapters in the Bible etc breakfast at nine – in the office generally from ten to two – visit etc from two to four &amp; dine at four (now nearly dark) at six go to reading, writing or the theatre, until ten – and at ten either go to bed or to a party –<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-039"><span id="endnote-039-backlink">39</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maxwell detested Russia and made this clear the first time he traveled to Scandinavia, in the summer of 1843:</p>
			<p class="Quote">You cannot imagine how I dislike the idea of returning to that dark and dismal land. If I were going any where else I would not care so much, but Russia to me now that I am out of it and dare say what I think is a horrible country and nothing but one vast prison house whose inmates are watched night and day by the most infamous police that ever existed.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-040"><span id="endnote-040-backlink">40</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">While in Russia, he wrote frequent, long, loquacious, detailed letters home, chiefly to his mother, but also to his father; his uncle, Dr. John Stevenson; and a few friends. His intention was to have them published later by <span class="CharOverride-1">Harper’s</span>. He was persuaded instead to write a book based on them. In 1848, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Czar, His Court and People: Including a Tour in Norway and Sweden</span> appeared and was well received. He sent a copy to Major Whistler with a great display of modesty.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-041"><span id="endnote-041-backlink">41</span></a></span> Deborah (Whistler) Haden also read it and considered parts of it to be in bad taste, having known or known of a number of the personages in it. The book is not important in a discussion of Anna Whistler’s diaries, while the detail of his letters is.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">When Maxwell left Russia permanently, he traveled some eighteen months in the Middle East and Western Europe. He had intended to go from Alexandria, Egypt, to Western Europe, but the two young Americans whom he met and was traveling with, Mr. Lewis and Mr. Thompson, persuaded him instead to extend his Egyptian stay by several weeks. Lewis had been at the Lawrenceville School at the same time as Maxwell; Thompson was acquainted with many of Maxwell’s close friends. Both were from Philadelphia, the sons of merchants there. They had gone to Canton, China, as supercargoes and made fortunes. Maxwell felt he should seize such an opportunity, assured by them that the expenses would be trifling. The fact that he had not ridden a horse in a long time, much less a camel, or fired a pistol for quite a while, did not seem to make him hesitate. This trio was together for four months. Their adventures included more than one encounter with robbers and the possibility of being murdered. Sometimes they themselves angrily and rashly pursued the robbers and sometimes were able to retrieve their possessions. Maxwell was provided for by members of both the American and British diplomatic corps at any site where a diplomat, usually a consul but sometimes an envoy or ambassador, was maintained. The three young men spent their evenings in card games, conversation, and entertained by female dancers, some of whom engaged in the most lascivious antics, which Maxwell chose not to record. The culmination of their Middle Eastern travels was the further extension of their trip by six weeks, taking them into Syria and Palestine, and included participation in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-042"><span id="endnote-042-backlink">42</span></a></span> Maxwell was moved when viewing the Holy Sepulchre, although he doubted that any of the locations insisted upon by their guides as connected with specific events associated with Christ’s death were really based on sufficient evidence, except for the location of Calvary.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He described visits on his own to the Mount of Olives, both on 18 and 19 April 1845, that show his excellent knowledge of scripture. He also described a group visit on 19 April 1845 to the Holy Sepulchre that is quite moving:</p>
			<p class="Quote">Preceded by Ali, and the guide and the Sexton we appeared quite formidable and the way was cleared quickly, to enable us to reach the entrance to the Sepulchre. I was sorry that I had not been prepared to follow the example of those who took off their boots or shoes, before treading upon a spot, which the faith of those around me invested with a holy character, even though my own investigations had led me to doubt, the truth of the tradition which represented this to be the Sepulchre of our Lord, I was sorry to enter with covered feet, and I thought I heard a murmur of surprise from those around me when I did so. I entered within the railing, surrounding the superstructure; – a step or two brought me near the low door way, and through this I descended about two feet and found myself in a small room or vault, filled with images encased in gold and silver, and before which burned many lights, lights I am told which are never permitted to expire, Before me was a white slab of marble, and upon this they told us, the body of our Lord was laid. It is not necessary for me to state the emotions I experienced when I looked at this – this which millions have looked upon with veneration, this which the millions of the Crusades had died to recover from the Infidels, this which was the object of the adoration of the thousands of Pilgrims around me and which ten’s of thousands would suffer much to see. I, at least, had made the Pilgrimage and with all the consolation this could afford me I retired from the Holy Sepulchre –<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-043"><span id="endnote-043-backlink">43</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In Great Britain at the culmination of his travels, Maxwell visited relatives of his father in England and Scotland, members of the Ranken family. In London he met his cousin John Smith Ranken, who was in business and had lost $35,000 on uninsured goods lost at sea. John’s brother Alexander, who had just been in London, had gone home to Glasgow. Their father expected Maxwell to stay with him when in Glasgow.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-044"><span id="endnote-044-backlink">44</span></a></span> This uncle lived at No.&nbsp;187 West Bath Street in Glasgow with his wife and eight children, who, together with those not living at home, numbered twelve. Maxwell also met Alexander Ranken’s wife, Octavia (Gibson) Ranken, whose mother was a Nyack neighbor. He arrived at the Rankens’ about 23 March and was still with them on Friday 27 March. Maxwell found Mr. Ranken “an amiable quiet, calm person, and how like my father, although not so handsome.” He was “a gentleman of great wealth and lives in some style” in a very large, fine house. Maxwell so enjoyed himself that he regretted not having known the Rankens sooner.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-045"><span id="endnote-045-backlink">45</span></a></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In all, Maxwell did not see his family in New York for over four years: from June 1842 until the end of summer 1846.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">During his travels and after his return to America, he corresponded with Major Whistler. Unfortunately, he did not keep the latter’s letters once he himself had published his book. This was also the fate of the letters Anna Whistler wrote him. He took on the task of seeing that the body of John Bouttatz Whistler was given proper burial in Stonington, Connecticut, in 1847, according to the wishes of Anna and Major Whistler. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maxwell met Anna Whistler and the boys at the dock in Jersey City in August 1849, when they returned to America after Major Whistler’s death.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-046"><span id="endnote-046-backlink">46</span></a></span> Anna Whistler referred to him in a letter to James as an appropriate role model for her son.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-047"><span id="endnote-047-backlink">47</span></a></span> Her 1850 diary shows that she and Maxwell were still in touch at that time.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-048"><span id="endnote-048-backlink">48</span></a></span> There is also some question as to whether she ever met his parents, who both verbally and through the gift of a dress and candy thanked her after she had nursed their son back to health. Maxwell had also proposed while still in Russia that his mother attempt to make the acquaintance of Martha (Kingsley) McNeill (see Image 22), Anna Whistler’s mother. Scholarship places stress, rather, on a relationship between Anna Whistler and an Anne (Young) Maxwell (Coldstream, Berwick 1784 – Nyack, NY, 20 October 1867), who was possibly related to Maxwell’s father. Anne (Young) Maxwell had known Eliza and Alicia McNeill when they were growing up in Berwick. It is with her that Anna Whistler took the waters at Richfield Springs, New York, in 1857.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-049"><span id="endnote-049-backlink">49</span></a></span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text">In 1848 or 1849, he decided to request consideration for the post of United States minister resident in the Ottoman Empire and was very favorably endorsed by his former superior, Colonel Charles S.

			<p class="Body-Text">Of Maxwell’s siblings, the most interesting was his younger sister, Agnes, who is mentioned as a child eight to ten years old in his letters to his mother from St.&#160;Petersburg. In 1853, in Paris, Agnes met and mutually fell in love with Major Philip Kearny (New York 1 June 1815 – Chantilly, VA 1 September 1862) of the United States Army. A married man, he was unable to obtain a divorce from his Catholic wife, and Agnes Maxwell chose to live with him openly. They had three children: Susan Watts Kearny (b. Paris 1856), Archibald Kennedy Kearny (25 January 1860 – 21 February 1862), and Virginia De Lancey Kearny (b. November 1860). In early 1858, Philip Kearny’s wife finally agreed to a divorce. Agnes Maxwell and Major Philip Kearny were married on 21 April 1858 at St. Matthew’s Church in Jersey City, New Jersey.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-065"><span id="endnote-065-backlink">65</span></a></span> Kearny died in 1862 on active duty during the Civil War.

			<p class="Body-Text">Given Maxwell’s love for the Whistler family, his parting with them when he was leaving Russia permanently must be described. Although he would correspond with Major and Anna Whistler, he would never see the former again, but did see Anna Whistler, James, and Willie again when they arrived in New York after Major Whistler’s death in 1849.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maxwell made two farewells to the Whistlers at Ritter’s house on consecutive nights, 1 and 2 November 1844, thinking that the visit of 1 November was his last. On that visit, he spent the entire day with them and was showered with gifts, by them and others. </p>
			<p class="Quote">Last evening was one of the most delightful and yet one of the saddest I have ever passed here. My friends the Whistler’s [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] old and young gave me the hours of yesterday for the purpose of saying my last adieus, may God bless and preserve them and may I see them again in my own dear country – Major W. presented me with a beutiful [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] silver tobacco box and M Whistler with a rich gold pencil case – In fact yesterday the presents came in quite fast and unfortunately I have no place to put them in or no way to carry them all upon my journey.

			<p class="Body-Text">On 2 November 1844, having done all his packing, he decided to go to the Whistlers’ home again to spend the few hours before the post coach left.</p>
			<p class="Quote">After a few brief visits I repaired to the Whistlers, and dined with them for the last time in Russia. The time flew rapidly. We spoke of the years that would have to pass ere we should meet again. M<span class="CharOverride-9U">rs</span> Whistler told me I should be remembered in her prayers, and again and again was I assured of the undying memory of our friendship. The clock struck 5, my old servant told me the carriage was at the door, little Willie slipped into my hand a little book as a parting gift, I said farewell, and accompanied by the Major drove to my rooms. I said goodbye to Miss Bensons, fees were paid the servants of the house, and I put on under the supervision of Whistler, the dress intended for my journey. Next my person was a good warm covering of woolen, over this I placed the Persian coat, the last gift of my dear and experienced friend, made of silk wadded with cotton, containing watch pocket etc, serving for vest and dress coat, and fastening with hook and eyes across the chest. Over this was my summer surtout, and then came my fur coat, which fortunately I had not parted with. To protect my feet I drew on an enormous pair of furred boots, covering my ordinary one’s [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] and reaching up to my knees. Around my neck was a monstrous shawl, upon my head a good warm cap with lappets for the ears, and my hands were protected by a pair of rabbit skin mittens. In addition to all this I carried upon my arm, <span class="CharOverride-S">a</span> my thick warm morning gown to use as occasion might require. Thus dressed, we stepped again into the carriage, the luggage was fastened on behind, and off we went to the Post house … At 7 o’clock the coach for Kovno on the frontier of Poland was announced and after one more adieu to those who had come to see me off, after one more greeting from and to my dear friend the Major, I took my seat … The night was very cold and dark. We soon passed Dom Drury the last summer residence of Whistler, and at 9 o’clock it began to snow tremendously.<span class="CharOverride-2"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-069"><span id="endnote-069-backlink">69</span></a></span></p>

Mrs. Kester, who, together with her husband, had attempted unsuccessfully to edit the letters, gave them in 1980 to the New-York Historical Society. Their content is invaluable in illuminating Part I of Anna Whistler’s diaries, but they are also helpful in illuminating portions of Part II of her diaries, the biographies of “The Whistlers As They Were in the 1840s” (except for that of George William Whistler), the <a href="3_benson.html">Benson</a> biography in this Appendix, and in supplying English translations of the words of the Russian romance in <a href="appendix_f.html">Appendix&nbsp;F</a>, once Anna Whistler had mentioned its Russian title. </p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">Materials other than Maxwell’s letters were placed in folders. The “Description” folder contains four pages describing the Maxwell Papers. The “Misc.” folder contains newspaper clippings, family letters, and a letter of introduction from Theodore S. Fay in Berlin dated “le 23 Juin 1844.” The “Diplomatic” folder contains a number of John S. Maxwell’s passports and his internal pass to travel to Moscow, Nizhnyi Novgorod, and Kazan in August 1842, just after his arrival in Russia, as well as requests for a courier’s passport for Abraham Priest Gibson. The “Printed” folder contains two ceremonials: one for the marriage of Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolaevna (see Image 446) and the other for that of her first cousin, Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mikhailovna (see Image 441). It also contains “‘The March of the Clans’, written by a lady for the anniversary festival of the St. Andrews Society of the State of New York. Nov. 30, 1850.” The “Poetry” folder contains a hand-written copy of “The Norwegian national song” marked “M<span class="CharOverride-9U">r</span> H Stoltenburg Mary’joy Norway July 5 –1843.” An unmarked folder contains one family letter from San José de Costa Rica, dated 14 November 1858. The author seems to be Hugh Maxwell Jr., brother of John S. Maxwell, to his sister-in-law, Caroline Ely (Mulligan) Maxwell.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">An uncatalogued sheet of paper in one of the folders of the J.S. Maxwell Papers contains the following note from Charlotte Tuttle Kester, written when she donated the Papers in 1980:</p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">Maxwell requested his family and friends to save his letters to them, for a journal or possible publication; he wrote Whistler from New York in 1848 that he would offer Harpers them for $3000.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-quotation">These letters are very interesting both as from an erudite, discerning young man, but as one involved in affairs diplomatic and political through connections.</p>

			<p class="Endnote-text"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="28_maxwell.html#endnote-002-backlink"><span id="endnote-002">2</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly believe that the image on page 52 of James Whistler’s <span class="CharOverride-1">St. Petersburg Sketchbook</span> in MacDonald, <span class="CharOverride-1">Catalogue Raisonné</span>, p. 9, is John Stevenson Maxwell. After Maxwell left Russia permanently in November 1844, he traveled extensively. In Greece, he spent Christmas Day 1844 in the home of Rev. John Henry Hill, who, together with his wife, Frances (Mulligan) Hill, ran a school in Athens for Greek boys and a second one for Greek girls. Reverend Hill asked him whether he was related to his friend of college days, Hugh Maxwell, because his resemblance to the latter was so great (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, Trieste, Monday, December 16. 1844; entry for Thursday, Dcember 26, NYHS: Maxwell Papers, no.&nbsp;49). Comparing the drawing in the <span class="CharOverride-1">Catalogue Raisonné</span> to Image 55 in this volume, a portrait of Hugh Maxwell painted in 1844, I think that he and the man wearing a hat (as well as the profile image beside it) in the <span class="CharOverride-1">Catalogue Raisonné</span>, greatly resemble one another.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">Maxwell was also told by John Randolph Clay that he resembled Captain Monroe, whom Clay knew in Russia, during the latter’s first tour of duty there (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, Hotel d’Angleterre. Warsaw. November 9. 1844. NYHS: Maxwell Papers, no.&nbsp;47).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">John Stevenson Maxwell did not number his letters to anyone but his mother, except when he first started writing to his family while on route to Russia in 1842 and was working out the procedure he would follow. At that point, he numbered a couple of letters to his father before completely switching the numbering over to his letters to his mother. This can create some confusion when citing letters in the Maxwell Papers.</p>

			<p class="Endnote-text2">Ali is Ali Hamet, the dragoman (translator) accompanying Maxwell, Lewis, and Thompson, He was well-known at the British Consulate in Alexandria and came highly recommended. A tall, handsome Arab, about 23-years old, he was taken to England when a boy by Lord Exmouth (1751–1833) and was fluent in English. Through his position at the British Consulate, he was entitled to wear a sword. His garb consisted of a red jacket “laced” with gold thread; loose, flowing, knee-length red pantaloons; long, white, tight-fitting stockings; and red Turkish slippers. He was married and his wife was in Alexandria. He eventually was put in charge of making all arrangements, including being their cook, for the trio of travelers. He ended up being very badly beaten by robbers, causing Maxwell to be very concerned and solicitous (John S. Maxwell to Mrs. Hugh Maxwell, NYHS: Maxwell Papers, nos. 52, 54, 55, 58). See also A.T. Mahan, “Admiral Lord Exmouth,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Atlantic Monthly</span> (July 1893): pp. 27–41.</p>
