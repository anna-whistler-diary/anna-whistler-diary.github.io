			<p class="Body-Text-Image">The Russian Orthodox Church calendar “begins with the Birth of the Holy Virgin on September 8th old or Julian calendar, September 21st new or Gregorian calendar. This holy day corresponds closely to the date of the Jewish New Year which to the Hebrews signified a new beginning of their life. Similarly the early Church, which generally closely followed the Old Testament celebrations of the Hebrews, proclaimed the new Christian era with the birth of the Holy Virgin, Who was to be the Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Who in turn by His birth, was to bring a new era into the world – the era of Christianity” (N.E. Mokhoff, ed. Holy Days of the Church: A Short Synopsis of Pascha and the Twelve Major Feasts and Fasts of the Orthodox Church [New York: Russian Orthodox Youth Committee, 2001], p. 1). The images of the icons shown here are presented according to the Russian Orthodox calendar year, starting with the birth of Mary and ending with her death.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text-Image">The icons discussed represent those of the twelve major feast days of the Russian Orthodox Church that Anna Whistler had occasion to be present during the celebration of, evoking from her comments of approval, disapproval, interpretation, misunderstanding, and sometimes sheer ignorance. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text-Image">Images are reprinted with permission from Mokhoff, Holy Days of the Church. In the twenty-first century, when Mokhoff’s book was published, the difference between Old and New Style became thirteen days.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Image 375</a></p>
			<p class="Body-Text-Image">Icon of the immoveable feast day of the Birth of the Most Holy Mother of God, Mary, daughter of the elderly couple Joachim and Anna. Her birth signifies that “the great task of saving mankind from enslavement to sin as promised to the first man” (Mokhoff, p. 3) has begun. While living on the Peterhof Road in the summer of 1844, Anna Whistler, hearing of this feast day, the first in the Church calendar year, celebrated on 8/20 September, confused it with the Epiphany, celebrated on 2/14 February, and then dismissed it as probably having to do with the Virgin Mary.</p>

An important feast day in the Russian Orthodox Church, Pentacost marks the beginning of the spread of Christianity (Mokhoff, p. 25). Anna Whistler mentions having attended the English Church that Sunday and points out that the poorer classes do not understand the meaning of this great feast day and regard it as the first day of summer.</p>
