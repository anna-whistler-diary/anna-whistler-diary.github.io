Their surviving children, five of whom appear in Anna Whistler’s St.&#160;Petersburg diaries, were Mary Tyler (13 October 1812 – 16 April 1894; see <a href="images_10.html#image266" target="_blank">Images 266–267</a>), William Hooper (10 March 1814 – 16 November 1891), Joseph Samuel (6 February 1818 – 14 March 1903), Sarah Louisa (19 July 1819 – 5 October 1910), Elizabeth Hannah (14 May 1825 – 25 November 1921; see <a href="images_10.html#image267" target="_blank">Image 267</a>), and Martha Reed (13 June 1826 – 21 August 1888).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> The first letter William Ropes opened on arriving in St.&#160;Petersburg on 16 June 1830 for the purpose of entering into business with Russia informed him of his wife’s death.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> He remained in Russia, while his children were placed in the homes of family and friends.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> On a trip back to Boston, he remarried, taking as his second wife, on 1 April 1832, Mary Anne Codman (12 July 1802 – 1 September 1873).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> On 20 April 1832, they sailed from New York for St.&#160;Petersburg, taking with them William Ropes’s four oldest children: Mary Tyler, William Hooper, Joseph Samuel, and Sarah Louisa.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> In August 1837, William Ropes departed St.&#160;Petersburg permanently with his wife and his daughters, Sarah Louisa and Martha Reed, leaving his House in the hands of William Hooper Ropes and a friend, Archibald Mirrielees (7 September 1797 – 11 February 1877; see <a href="images_10.html#image268" target="_blank">Image 268</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> It is William Ropes’s older children from his first marriage, primarily Mary Tyler (Ropes) Gellibrand and William Hooper Ropes, and the wife and children of William Hooper Ropes, whom the Whistlers were close to in St.&#160;Petersburg. They were well acquainted while there with Joseph Samuel, Elizabeth Hannah, and Martha Reed Ropes. All of these Ropes family members appear in the diaries, but no mention is made there of Sarah Louisa.</p>

			<p class="Body-Text">Early in his stay in St.&#160;Petersburg, William Ropes spoke of William Clarke Gellibrand (31 March 1791 – 20 April 1884; see <a href="images_10.html#image265" target="_blank">Image 265</a>), “Egerton Hubbard’s partner.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> Mr. Gellibrand, son of Reverend William (28 May 1763 – 27 September 1840) and Sophia (Hinde) Gellibrand (12 January 1759 – 20 November 1793),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> was “a native of Hampshire, England.” He “had a good education at a high school” and “learned the elements of Latin and Greek, with which languages he later became familiar.” “At a proper age he went to reside as a clerk to Mr. Morgan, one of the principal Merchants in Archangel.” In 1813, he went to St.&#160;Petersburg to work for the House of Morgan there, acting as manager under Mr. Morgan and handling the business for him. In 1822, he started a business in partnership with a Mr. Holliday. Mr. Holliday handled the business in St.&#160;Petersburg, while Mr. Gellibrand handled the Moscow end. In 1828, however, Mr. Gellibrand was led to suspect that there were irregularities in the St.&#160;Petersburg end of the business and eventually discovered that his partner had been defrauding their firm. Mr. Gellibrand’s name was cleared in the matter by Mr. Holliday. Of the offers of employment now made to him, Mr. Gellibrand accepted that of Mr. Hubbard, Mr. Morgan’s brother-in-law, to join their House. He spoke French, German, and Russian. He was “the most active of [their] little church.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> On 27 December 1825, Mr. Gellibrand married in England Elizabeth Parkinson (20 June 1794 – 5 February 1833) and brought her out to Russia. On William Ropes’s return to St.&#160;Petersburg with his second wife and four of his children in 1832, his family too became part of this circle that belonged to the dissenting chapel, gave room and board to ministers traveling to and through St.&#160;Petersburg, distributed tracts, participated in the work of the Dorcas Society and was collecting money to build its own building, the eventual British and American Congregational Church (see <a href="images_6.html#image125" target="_blank">Image 125</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> On 24 January / 5 February 1833, Mrs. Gellibrand died. On 27 January / 8 February, she was buried from the Sarepta Chapel,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> the meeting house of the German Moravian Brethren, which the dissenters used until they had their own church.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> In February of 1834, William Clarke Gellibrand and Mary Tyler Ropes became engaged, despite the fact that he was almost twice her age. They were married on 1/13 May 1834<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> in the English Church (see <a href="images_6.html#image110" target="_blank">Images 110–111</a>), Rev.

Mr. Gellibrand “rented Brammerton Hall in Norfolk from his old friend, Captain Haggard … the father of Rider Haggard, the novelist.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> They spent only a year at Brammerton Hall, because the climate of Norfolk was also too severe, and then moved to Albyns in Stapleford Abbots, Essex.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> It is here that Mr. Gellibrand died.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> Judging from the number of members of the clergy present at his funeral, he had been very generous to various churches.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He left a personal estate of almost £72,000. Mrs. Gellibrand was his sole executrix and heir.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> She gave up Albyns, bought the Manor House in Chigwell, Essex, and lived there, with Sarah Louisa Ropes, until her death on 16 April 1894.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> The gross value of her personal estate was almost £59,000, and her will was twenty-eight pages long.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> She spread her money about, giving most of it to relatives, some to employees, some to friends, including former ministers of the dissenting church in St.&#160;Petersburg, Rev. John Croumbie Brown and Rev. Thomas Scales Ellerby, and some to the British and Foreign Bible Society and to its Benevolent Fund.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Anna Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Images 1–5</a>) maintained close ties with the Gellibrands, particularly after she settled in England. She made an annual visit to them at Albyns, sometimes meeting other St.&#160;Petersburg friends there, and at Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas received a large hamper of food from them.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> Mrs. Gellibrand, in turn, visited Anna Whistler in London.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text">Very little is known about Elizabeth Hannah’s life. She is listed in the Gellibrand household in the 1871 Census but not in the censuses for 1861, 1881, or 1891. She is listed in the 1881 Census as a boarder in Eastbourne, Sussex, in the house of Heber D. Ellis, a physician; her condition is registered as “lunatic.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> Financial provision was made in Mary Tyler (Ropes) Gellibrand’s will for her care. The last surviving child of William and Martha (Reed) Ropes, she died on 25 November 1921 at The Priory, a hospital or nursing home in London.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text">Somewhat more is known of Sarah Louisa Ropes. She was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span> and came to St.&#160;Petersburg with the family in 1832. In February 1836, she was being attended by “Dr. Arendt, an eminent German physician … once a week” in consultation with the family physician,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> and in August of the same year was in England because of lung trouble.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span> She left Russia with her father and step-family and became “quite an English girl”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span> but felt “that her home [was] with her brothers and sisters” and in September 1838 was back in Russia with the Gellibrands.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> She most likely divided her time between them and her father and step-family. When the Gellibrands moved to England, she joined them and is listed in their household in the 1861, 1871, 1881 censuses and with the widowed Mary Tyler (Ropes) Gellibrand in the 1891 Census. She too received a large inheritance from Mary Tyler (Ropes) Gellibrand. Sarah Louisa Ropes died on 5 October 1910 in London, leaving effects of about £5,000.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> She made charitable bequests and left a small sum to her sister, Elizabeth Hannah, but the bulk of her estate went to her nieces and nephews, the children of William Hooper Ropes and of Martha Reed (Ropes) Trask.</p>
			<p class="Asterisk">*    *    *</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Martha Reed Ropes was not yet six years old when her father, step-mother, brothers, and sisters left for St.&#160;Petersburg in 1832. She came to Russia when Elizabeth Hannah did and seems to have left with her father and step-family in 1837.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> Anna Whistler’s diaries record Martha’s visit to William Hooper Ropes, Mary Tyler (Ropes) Gellibrand, and Elizabeth Hannah Ropes in 1844, when she was eighteen. Between 1 March 1840 and 19 October 1845, Martha Reed appeared to be living alternately in East Brighton, Massachusetts, and near Islington, London. In that same timespan, she compiled four volumes of abstracts of sermons and one of poetry.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> On 9 October 1849, she married Charles Hooper Trask (4 September 1824 – 11 December 1905).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-041">41</a></span></span> Trask attended Amherst College in 1841–1843 and graduated from Yale in 1846.

			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-010"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010-backlink">10</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;All the foregoing information is taken from the letter of Wm. Ropes to Hardy Ropes, St. P. Feb. 10/22, 1834, HUBL: Ropes Papers.</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-011"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011-backlink">11</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about the British and American Congregational Church (often called simply the British and American Chapel) is difficult to find and contradictory. Two excellent contemporary sources on the houses of worship of St.&#160;Petersburg substantially dissipate this confusion, when compared to one another. </span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">Antonov and Kobak, in <span class="CharOverride-1">Sviatyni Sankt-Peterburga</span>, explain that a congregation was formed on 6 December 1833 including the Congregationalists, which seven years later separated from the Anglicans. The congregation bought a building, to which, in 1839–1840, the architect Karl-Wilhelm Winkler (1813–1861) added from the courtyard side a double-lighted hall holding 250 persons, although there were far fewer Congregationalists in St.&#160;Petersburg at that time. In 1890, for the fiftieth anniversary of the Chapel, the front building was expanded into a two-story structure according to the plans of civil engineer F.V. [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>: F.N.] Sobolevskii (1831–1892) and redecorated (Antonov and Kobak, <span class="CharOverride-1">Sviatyni Sankt-Peterburga</span>, pp.&#160;269, 383, 388). </p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">Shul’ts’s explanation is as follows. The building of the Methodist British–American Church and the prayer hall of Christ the Savior of the Hutterites and the prayer hall of the Sarepta Brotherhood was built on New-Isaac Street in 1820 [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>: 1840] according to the plan of the civil engineer F.N. Sobolevskii (1831–1892). When it was being built, the foundation and walls of the house previously standing on that spot in the 1780s and 1790s and the entire adjacent plot, all belonging to Count A.A. Bezborodko, were included (Shul’ts, <span class="CharOverride-1">Khramy Sankt-Peterburga</span>, p.&#160;261). </p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">A valuable source about the Church are the letters from St.&#160;Petersburg of the Ropes family members to their relatives in Massachusetts in the 1830s cited in these Notes. They show that the congregation was in existence in 1832, when William Ropes arrived in Russia for the second time; that they were collecting money to build their own church; and that in the meantime they met in the meeting house of the German Moravian Brethren (Mary T. Ropes to Uncle Hardy Ropes, St. P. 19 June 1832, St. P. June 30/July 12, 1833, and St. P. 3 July N.S., and St. P. Cronstadt June 1/14 [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>], 1833, HUBL: Ropes Papers; Wm. Ropes to Hardy Ropes, St. P. 4 Dec. N.S. 1832).</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">When Anna Whistler came to Russia, the British and American Congregational Church was well-established in its building on New-Isaac Street, and she sometimes attended services there. </p>

			<p class="Endnote-quotation">Albyns is the house of all others to interest your Father. Our dear old friends have had a lease of it 17 years, it is therefore in the highest state of cultivation & has the most choice trees & shrubs to ornament, besides fine Oaks & green fields, I need not go beyond the garden walks for exercise daily they are so extensive, but I look beyond them & see in the pastures 20 Cows! Mr G-s fancy to have so many [,] of course the poor all around have milk as much as they want[.] Mrs G is the lady bountiful most fully verified and the most perfect symptom of a christian household is here kept up. cheerfulness & devotedness shewn by the many servants who assemble with us regularly for family worship noon & evening. On Sunday evenings, we all enjoy singing hymns with them in the library, where the Grand piano is. Some of our St P neighbours have happened to be guests with me now, & Ailie Ropes here also. We have enjoyed drives almost every afternoon in this prettiest part of Essex, I who have a rather solitary life, feel so grateful for the companionship of those sympathising friends. We are all at liberty to occupy our morning as we like, while Mrs G attends to her affairs and when I stroll thro the garden surrounded by such a variety of choice sweet gay flowers & look above at the blue sky & bright sun I involuntarily think “These are Thy works Almighty Parent Thine the universal good” Such a noble Cedar of Lebanon faces my room window! & a Magnolia Grand de Flora is trained to the roof of the house, it had six beautiful blossoms when I first came. rains have defaced them, but rain is so needed, since the unusual drought of the past months. The harvest of grain gathered in, said to be in all parts of England finer & more abundant Harvest than for 30 years.

On 11 June 1841, however, Nicholas I spent the day at home with the members of his family and retinue in the dacha in Aleksandriia at Peterhof, except for an afternoon ride, the duration of which would not have allowed him to ride into St. Petersburg (RGIA: <span class="CharOverride-1">Kamer-fur’erskii zhurnal</span>).

It becomes clear in this letter that he has customers to whom he supplies milk. Notes written on the letter clarify that “Sashy” Prince is dead. I am grateful to Mr. S.
